The trip takes longer than expected. At least it feels much longer.

You’re 22 years old, fresh out of a Bachelor’s degree in Corporate Communication, whatever that’s supposed to mean, and you’re almost broke. An airplane ticket is out of the question. 

So you take the bus to London, where you catch the Eurostar to Paris; it’s crowded and not particularly comfortable; you have to wait a couple of hours in Paris before catching the international train from Gare de Lyon, where you settle in a comfortable position in your third-class seat. 

You feel a little anxious, but hopeful that something better is waiting for you out there.

Something new.

$A[Why did I decide to do this anyways?]

It certainly wasn’t the money, though your bank account could appreciate every little bit it can get. 

“You’ll see the world and become wiser!” your mum said.

“You’ll nail some hot Romanian chicks!” argued your friends.

&quot;I&#39;ll finally have time to work on my book!&quot; you said to yourself.

You bought into those arguments and now here you are, ready for an adventure.

The train takes several days as it chugs its way through the green fields of eastern France, the small villages in the mountains of Germany and the hills of Austria, filled with more wind turbines and farms than you thought possible. 

You stop every now and then, get off at some station where you have a coffee and a sandwich while you chat to some random people, waiting for your next train relay. As you go farther East the locals speak less and less English and the polite Germanic accents are replaced with friendly but confused Slavic tones. You smile and nod, trying to remember some of the words. 

$A[After all, this is what it’s all about, right?]

The final train drops you off at Timisoara, a big city in western Romania. From there you take another bus to Lugoj, but after that things get harder. You have to get to a village that’s so small it’s not even on the map. You spend the night at a cheap hotel then convince one of the locals to give you a ride in exchange for what little you have left in your wallet. 

$I[You lost 80£]

He drives silently as you follow the river Timish deeper into the mountains. The road is steep and perilous and in progressively worse condition the further away you go. You begin to wonder if you haven&#39;t fallen victim to some scam, the big country man next to you driving towards a secluded location... 

Before you have too much time to dwell on these thoughts, you spot a handful of rooftops nested among the trees.

In any case, you arrive at //a village//.

$a[&#39;Am I at the right place?&#39;] you ask the man, but he shrugs, takes a few paces around the car to stretch his legs, then gets back in and drives off.

You look around - there is a road sign with a name, but it&#39;s broken, half of it missing and the edge charred as if struck by lightning. Even on the remaining part the paint is so old that you can’t really make out any of the letters. Still, this has to be it - there are no other villages nearby.

The village itself is very small - a main street and a few clusters of stone houses, few dozens at best. The mountain air is clean and fresh, filling your nostrils with the scent of old pines and green moss. Save for a few electric lamps barely illuminating the street, it doesn’t look very modern. Judging by the architectural style, it hasn&#39;t moved in the last few centuries. 

$A[Old and authentic, no technological distractions... this could be good for writing and inspiration. I&#39;m sure there are lots of legends and folklore to get out of the locals, if I ask them nicely...]

You notice a congregation of buildings that’s bound to be the main square.

There isn&#39;t much here and you feel somewhat lost.

$a[‘Excuse me, I’m looking for… “The Crooked Elm” hotel. It’s in this village…’] In your best Romanian you address a passerby, a man in his forties wearing a respectable however old-fashioned suit. 

Along with your explanation you vaguely gesture around, hoping that you don’t sound too ridiculous. Given how few houses there are it’s somewhat embarrassing that you haven’t found the place yourself.

‘The residence is located outside of town’ he replies, surprising you with his flawless English and deep, suave voice. ‘Head down the main road this way - there is a small torrent that later joins into the river. Follow the path upstream, towards the mountains, and you shall find it in about an hour.’

$a[‘An hour!’] you exclaim. Just when you thought your journey was over.

You can make out the road the gentleman is talking about and even if you haven’t brought much luggage with you the thought of carrying your bags uphill for an hour disheartens you.

$a[‘Isn’t there some sort of transportation?’]  

You turn around, but the man is gone. In fact there isn’t anyone else around - if you didn’t know any better, you would have said that the village was deserted. 
 
The trees rustle in the wind. It’s only 6 p.m. but the village is on an eastern slope and with the sun blocked behind the tall ridges, the world is already sinking in velvet shadows. 

You sigh.

After what seems like an eternity of back pain and sweating along the old stony path, the trees thin out on the left and you see a tall ornate gate with metal bars, surrounded by a sturdy iron fence.

(display:&quot;eye&quot;)(link-repeat:&quot;Examine the gate&quot;)[(replace:?obs)[It appears to be hand forged and pretty solid, despite its state.

&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/environments/mansion.png&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
It’s several stories high, a central part and two wings with several towers and balconies looming over the mournful garden. It’s hard to make out everything in the darkness, but you estimate it has at least two dozen guest rooms, perhaps more. 

$A[Wow... the place must have been a real luxury resort back in the day, perhaps then the village was a popular tourist destination? A shame, now it reeks of disuse and decay... Could be a cool place to stay, but I doubt they get many visitors.

You stumble inside a reception room with a dusty wooden desk and several hallways splitting in different directions. On the right side there is a large staircase leading somewhere up in the darkness. The whole place is scarcely illuminated by a handful of candles, most attached to the walls. 

$Io[&#39;Your room vill be ready in a moment.&#39;] The man drops your luggage on the floor and takes the staircase, which creaks under each of his heavy steps. You follow the glow of his candle as he moves up until he takes a turn and disappears somewhere on the upper floor.

The desk is relatively large and made from heavy, thick wood. It&#39;s furniture from another generation, when chairs and desks were built to last. You don&#39;t think you could ever move it, even if you tried. 

There&#39;s also a little stand on it with a sign that currently reads &quot;CLOSED&quot;. Behind it is a stack of other signs - you flip through them: &quot;OPEN&quot;, &quot;BACK IN 10 MINUTES&quot;, &quot;BEWARE OF DOG&quot;. The last one looks like it hasn&#39;t been used for a while.

$Mi[&#39;Very well, then. I&#39;ll show you to your room.&#39;]

Mihai heads to the staircase and starts climbing, waving you a hand to follow him. In the candlelight the many jeweled rings on his hand glitter mysteriously.

You grab your bags and one of the candles.

The upper floor is covered by a soft red carpet that absorbs almost all noise. You can see a variety of weapons and trophies hung on the walls, as well as an ominous figure standing at the far end. You squint your eyes and then relax - it&#39;s just an old piece of armor.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
You try to tentatively stomp the floor, but it&#39;s almost inaudible. For a while you&#39;re lost in the silence, not hearing the familiar tapping of Mihai&#39;s cane. Silence and darkness... 

Your eyes fall on a golden door right in front of you. One of many, in fact, as you realise looking both ways.

$A[I wonder what the room is like...]

$Mi[&#39;Over here, Mister Reid&#39;]

You see the light of the candle to the right, moving upwards still to the next floor.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
The next floor is almost identical, save for the carpet being purple and the doors a dark green. You can make out a handful of portraits along the walls, but before you have time to look properly at any of them, Mihai continues upwards.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Follow-&gt;Mihai continues upwards.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Maybe take a quick glance inside the room..." tags="floor1 elm" position="1276,9602" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-FLOOR 1-]&lt;/div&gt;

You grab the doorhandle and twist it to the side, when you get the eerie sensation that you&#39;re being watched. With the corner of your eye you catch a flickering in the distant end of the hallway.

You turn around, but there&#39;s nothing there. Even with squinting your eyes, you can&#39;t tell what was the thing that flickered.

$A[What the hell...? Do they have security cameras in this place?]

You look left and right again, trying to locate the source of your anxiety, but the dark hallways offer little consolation. In the end you leave the door alone.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Follow your host-&gt;Follow]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Mihai continues upwards." tags="floor3 elm" position="1443,9381" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-ATTIC-]&lt;/div&gt;

The third floor is noticeably different, with naked walls and many doors that have been locked or even nailed shut.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$Mi[&#39;The garrets and storage rooms are on this floor.&#39;] says Mihai. $Mi[&#39;As well as the staircases that lead to the towers. But Ionut will give you a proper tour around tomorrow. You must be terribly tired. This is your room.&#39;]

He leads you to a door located not far on the left, quite similar to the others, except for the noticeable lack of padlocks or chains. Mihai produces a single key from the inside of his vest and with a subtle //click// the door opens.

$A[That must be the master key that opens every door around here... makes sense. No need for *him* to carry a large batch of keys around.]

$Mi[&#39;Sleep well. Tomorrow is Sunday and we aren&#39;t expecting any visitors, so you&#39;ll have the day to yourself. Use it to get familiar with the place. Go to the village if you like, but don&#39;t spend the whole day there. Your work starts on Monday morning. Ionut will explain your duties.&#39;]

You nod and smile politely.

Small and simple, your room has just the bare necessities - a bed, a wardrobe, a desk and a chair. A single window is looking out to what you expect is the back garden. There is also a nightstand with a drawer and a lamp, candlestick and an inkwell on top.

You wake up refreshed, your hard mattress and simple cover providing surprisingly good sleep. Looking through the window in the daylight, you can see a large garden spanning behind the manor - alleys lined with elm trees, stone benches and statues, even a little fountain.

You get dressed, picking a pair of jeans and t-shirt. The day is ahead of you, but perhaps first you should have some breakfast?

After some searching you find the dining hall on the ground floor, near the reception. It&#39;s a spacious room lined with tall windows creating the illusion of a glass wall looking towards the garden. The light that stems in is a dirty grey, and while a little melancholic, you don&#39;t find it unpleasant.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/ionut_3.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
You look at the antique chairs and tables, wondering if they&#39;re fully functional or just for decoration.

$Io[&#39;Sit! Today - I cook. Vat do you vant?&#39;]

The servant&#39;s face peers through an opening in the opposite wall, complete with a metal counter and stacks of plates.

$A[That must be the kitchen...]

$a[&#39;I&#39;ll have eggs and bacon.&#39;] you shout back.

$Io[&#39;Coming vright up!&#39;]

Soon you hear a pleasant sizzling and then Ionut comes out, dropping a hot plate of bacon and eggs on your table. You notice that he walks a little funny, but your mind is busy elsewhere. $A[Perhaps his leg hurts?] It doesn&#39;t matter. You start munching and tell yourself that he doesn&#39;t look like a bad guy after all. Yesterday he looked a little creepy, insidious even, but right now you&#39;re willing to believe he&#39;s just the average Joe who happens to have a strong accent and misshapen, bald head. It&#39;s hardly his fault.

$Io[&#39;It is gud, ja?&#39;]

$a[&#39;Ja, ja, sehr gut!&#39;] you reply instinctively. The trip through Europe really scrambled your head with languages. Before you can correct your mistake however, he returns to the kitchen.

You push your empty plate aside and pat your belly. That was a good breakfast. As if sensing that you&#39;re done, the servant emerges again and comes to sit in front of you, placing two cups of coffee on the table.

$Io[&#39;Nice to meet. I Ionut.&#39;] he grins at you.

$a[&#39;Hello, Ionut, I&#39;m Alex,&#39;] you reply.

There is an awkward pause.

$Io[&#39;So, start tomorrow.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Yes. What do I have to do?&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Several things. Virst: stay at reception.&#39;]

$a[&#39;The whole day?&#39;]

$Io[&#39;From 6 to 10.&#39;]

$a[&#39;6 to 10?!&#39; that&#39;s 16 hours!&#39;]

$Io[&#39;No, only 4 hours&#39;], he corrects you - $Io[&#39;6 in the avternoon.&#39;]

You look at Ionut, confused.

$Io[&#39;Nobody come early. Guest come - they sleep; they go.&#39;]

$A[That explains why the pay is so low...but I&#39;ll have lots of free time, so that&#39;s not too bad.]

$Io[&#39;Help move their luggage to room. Give key, of course. Keys behind desk.&#39;]

Ionut takes a sip from his coffee, as if thinking if he&#39;s forgetting anything. His skin, pale and thick, makes his face look like an unfinished clay sculpture. 

$a[&#39;So... that&#39;s it?&#39;] You still can&#39;t believe that your work day is only 4 hours.

$Io[&#39;That&#39;s it. During day you free. If need help - I ask, you come. If Mister Petrescu need something - he tell you. Rest of time - up to you. Try not get lost in the forest.&#39;]

You drink your own coffee, letting the information sink in. It seems that you&#39;ll have some time on your hands.

Ionut gives you a nod and finishes his coffee. While he drinks, you notice that the thumb on this right hand is abnormally large and a slightly different shade. $A[Perhaps a birth defect?]

He returns to the kitchen with his slightly waddling walk, leaving you alone with your thoughts. The day is still young and you have some options of what to do.

The manor is surrounded by an expansive garden circled by the fence which you first saw last night. You walk along it for a while, but it keeps going as far as you can see, the terrain becoming rougher and even less well-kept the farther away from the mansion you go. 

Eventually the low, sickly grass is replaced by ever taller thorns and bushes, making your advance difficult. When you&#39;re about to give up, you notice another $in[gate] in the fence.

You know that the village isn&#39;t much, but it&#39;s still your closest link to civilization, so you force yourself to do the hour walk downhill, trying not to think that you&#39;ll have to climb back again.

You arrive at the village winded, but the fresh mountain air helps you quickly cool down. The tall mountain trees cast the village into a deep shade and despite the burning summer sun in its zenith, the place feels veiled from its heat.

$A[Like it was in another world...]

You explore the village roads, the fleeting faces of its inhabitants glancing at you through the windows as you go. You never meet anyone&#39;s gaze directly, but you can feel their eyes on the back of your head, following you around. 
(set: $duh to 1)
You expected the village to be only a few simple households, but during your walk you discover there is an $in[antique shop], a small $in[inn] and a $in[hunting cabin].

Hidden in between two massive stone houses, the antique shop is a sort of extension linking its neighbours, making you think of some sort of small critter that saw an empty space and decided to dwell there. Its narrow facade - with barely enough space for a small door and a single window - and irregular architecture is the reason you miss it the first few times, but you eventually notice the faded inscription in front &quot;ANT  QUE   BOUTI UE&quot;.

You push the door of the boutique, bending a little to avoid hitting your head on the low doorframe. The inside of the shop is dusty and cramped with hundreds of small objects - you see furniture and decorations; jewelry, small figurines and toys; watches, mostly mechanical as far as you can tell; pens and quills; posters, stamps and postcards, a lot of ornate boxes and an immense sea of undefined and unknowable shapes. 

The shop is illuminated by small electric bulbs that cover everything with a dirty, yellow light, as if it was a second-hand light used and reused throughout the centuries and too tired to shine like it used to. The boutique, though cramped and narrow, extends inward, like the belly of a giant whale which has swallowed thousands of objects over its life and now lies comatose, slowly digesting.

With the corner of your eye you sense something moving.

Seemingly out of nowhere, a young woman has appeared behind the counter, looking at you with a mischievous smile. At first glance she appears no older than yourself, probably in her early twenties. Her hair is dark and curly, with a tinge of violet, her skin - flawless and pale like marble, and her green eyes - is that a hint of yellow? - peer straight through you with a wild, feline stare.

$M[&#39;You look like a man in need of an accessory.&#39;] She decides looking you up and down. $M[&#39;Perhaps a watch?&#39;]

Without waiting for your reply, she transitions instantaneously from one side of the counter to the other, standing next to you, her fingers already picking different watches from the dusty shelves, giving them a soft brush before sliding them around your wrist, giving a short $M[&quot;tss, tss, not the right one&quot;] and putting them back on the row again. 

$a[&#39;I-, oh-, wait-&#39;]

$M[&#39;Not a watch then? I understand. Not really your thing. But you need something, oh yes, I can sense that you need something. Something to keep you safe, something to keep you //fresh//.&#39;]

The woman disappears into the belly of the beast, her movements fast and perfectly silent. Within several heartbeats she returns, carrying something in her hand. Before you can react she wraps it around your wrist, tying it with a little knot.

You look down and notice that you now have a new $in[bracelet].

You wonder aimlessly around, exploring the mazelike innards of the room. The tomes don&#39;t seem to be organised in any particular fashion and even if they were, most of the titles are too faded and illegible. Without any indication or a specific topic of research, you decide to just go for it and pick some books at random.

You try a couple of times anyways to see what you&#39;d find, but it&#39;s mostly filled with old history, names, places, and dynasties that don&#39;t mean anything to you. 

(unless: $diary_found is 1)[You&#39;ve almost given up hope on finding anything interesting, when a particular place catches your eye.

Perhaps you will be able to find something about the jewel, or the antique shop you got it from. $Felicia was way too young to be mentioned in a book, but in such a small village the antique shop is probably a family business, so you might find something about her ancestors...

You start going through the tomes, searching for any relevant topics that might shine a light on the subject. After a significant time of digging through the old volumes, you gather a few volumes.

It appears to be some sort of history book, the yellow pages printed with the heavy, slightly smudged ink of the old printing press. You open the volume at page 25:

$B1[**Dating back to the Slavic tribes before the middle ages, the inhabitants of what is known today as the Romanian mountains have always followed a strict code of social and geopolitical hierarchy, separating the region into autonomous constituencies known as &quot;hills&quot;. Every hill had its own ruler, a hereditary title, who held power over the land and its people and in exchange vowed to protect his subjects. 

Some believe that the modern expression &quot;king of the hill&quot; originated from these early societal structures. Throughout the history of the region, different countries and kings have claimed the territories to be within their borders, but they have mostly respected the hills and their power.**]

It&#39;s a small book with black covers made from some soft tissue. On the front there is a faded picture of a cat standing on top of a pile of books. The colors are faded now but it&#39;s clear that they were once vibrant and gay. You&#39;re not quite sure why you picked it up, other than the fact that it had &quot;antique&quot; in the title. The language is somewhat difficult to read as your Romanian is far from perfect. You open the first page:

A red volume with thin white paper, &quot;Legends from the Mountains&quot; is a collection of myths and old tales accompanied with exquisite drawings in colour. You open a chapter at random:

$B2[//Transylvanian folklore has become known worldwide for its legends about **vampires**. One of the common misconceptions however, associated with this mythos, is the portrayal of the vampire as a solitary creature that inhabits some distant and forsaken place such as a castle or a ruin. 

In truth, vampires are depicted in the old tales as social creatures that live in packs and abide by a strict hierarchy. Every pack is led by an Elder,  a powerful being that has acquired knowledge and skills over centuries. He is followed by his son^^1^^ and then by a handful of lesser vampires who usually do not live in the same place but in surrounding villages or dwellings, which together form the **Elder Covenant**.

^^1^^//]$B2sub[ The Elder always has a single son to avoid infights for the heritage. While vampires are portrayed with a lifespan of centuries, they&#39;re not believed to be immortal, and thus the son eventually replaces his father and becomes the new Elder. Elders do not take other vampires for wives for the same reason - a potential claim for power - and thus resort to humans for the purpose of breeding.]

The room plunges in silver darkness, silhouettes outlined by the shine of the almost full moon outside. You lie on the hard mattress, thinking about the mysterious events of the day.

You descend to the second floor, the velvet carpet muffling your footsteps. Even in the cold light of the morning the manor looks shadowy and unwelcoming, the dust hanging in the air like thick goo.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/Elise_v2.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
To your surprise, one of the doors on your right opens and a woman walks out in the hallway, walking towards you without a sound. 

She is tall and dark - her ebony skin and short black hair reflecting the light with an almost metallic sheen. However what is most peculiar about her are her proportions - her head is small and thin, her stick-like arms flail around her equally thin torso which is covered with a tight leather jacket. And still, despite this slim and skinny upper section, under her waist her body bulges out into an entirely different shape: her ass - round and protruding - is almost a separate entity altogether, occupying - you genuinely wonder - almost as much space as the rest of her.
(set: _ti to 8)
As she closes the distance towards you, her round green spectacles - glare straight at you, like a pair of alien eyes. Her gaze makes your heart pound faster, filling you with indescribable, inexplicable emotions. 

The woman raises a hand gloved in the same black leather and points a bony finger at you:

$E[&#39;You must be the new maid. My room requires assistance.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Uhm, I&#39;m not a handmaid...&#39;]

$E[&#39;Tsk, tsk, darling. Don&#39;t make a fuss. Names are irrelevant, what&#39;s important is the job. My room is number 28. Now be a darling and clean it up.&#39;]

Serving the guests is your job after all, so you push down your objections. Besides, there&#39;s something in her commanding voice that compels you to obey her, though you&#39;re not sure exactly how you feel about that.

$E[&#39;Splendid, tsk.&#39;]

The woman smiles and slides away.

In a few brief moments, she has made a lasting impression on you. Her green lips linger in your mind&#39;s eye as you walk down the hallway. Her smile was somehow both soft and cruel.

You have to know more. You decide to find an opportunity to talk to her.

$I[New task added to journal] (set: $task_elise to 1)

In any case, cleaning up shouldn&#39;t take too long and you can have breakfast afterwards. You gulp down your pride and stroll down the hallway. The woman&#39;s room is almost at the end, and as you approach you notice that the door is slightly ajar.

You decide to ignore the woman&#39;s request for now. The day has just begun and you&#39;ll have plenty of time to do it later. You&#39;d much rather start easy, perhaps with a //breakfast//. The woman frowns, but remains silent.

Turning your back to the guest, you descend the staircase. But then again, aren&#39;t you supposed to be at her disposal? In a moment of doubt, you turn around. The hallway is empty.

$A[She&#39;s already gone, then it probably wasn&#39;t very important...]

With a hungry stomach, you enter the dining hall and are greeted with a strange sight. All the windows have been covered with heavy curtains, such that barely any sunlight enters the room at all. To compensate for this, candles have been lit on almost all of the tables, their faint flames doing little but pushing the darkness a couple of feet away.

Sitting on a large ornate table not far from the entrance, you recognise the silhouette of a man with a golden cane.

A few minutes later, while you&#39;re eating in the semi-complete darkness of the dining hall, a new silhouette enters the room.

She takes a seat across the table from Mihai, occupying what appears to be the biggest armchair you&#39;ve ever seen, with a seat large enough for two people to sit on side by side comfortably and a tall back covered in numerous fancy cushions. Her slim body and small round head look almost ridiculous in comparison, yet somehow she seems to fill the chair quite nicely with the rest of her body...

Looking at her you start getting a headache and you move your gaze away, rubbing your tired eyes. The room is so dark and the candles so faint that the shadows are starting to play tricks on you.. Bits of the conversation make their way to you, but it&#39;s too low and jumbled to make any sense.

You walk along it for a while, but it keeps going as far as you can see, the terrain becoming rougher and even less well-kept the farther away from the mansion you go. 

Eventually the low, sickly grass is replaced by ever taller thorns and bushes, making your advance difficult. When you&#39;re about to give up, you notice another $in[gate] in the fence, a little farther down the road.

The inside of the basement is more akin to the opening of a dungeon, with a cold stony floor and pillars supporting the manor on top. There are matches left near the hatch and you use them to light a torch which illuminates well enough the space several feet around you.

There are pipes and valves covering most of the east wall and going into the ceiling, as well as a handful of crates, a workbench and some tools hanging near it, more torches and cobwebs wobbling by the cold draft; and of course, there is the [[generator]].

Besides, when you get back down you&#39;ll lock the gate behind you and sneak the key on Ionut&#39;s keyring. Nobody will ever know a thing...

You start climbing, using the screen of your phone as a source of light to guide your way. Even if there isn&#39;t any reception up here, at least it&#39;s good for something. 

The staircase continues for quite some time, spiraling upwards for what seems like hundreds of steps. From time to time there are doors on the side, but you&#39;re really interested in getting to the top.

After what seems like an eternity, you reach the last step and a small platform leading to a single wooden door. Fortunately enough, there isn&#39;t any lock here, only a brass handle that looks like it hasn&#39;t been used in a while.

You draw a deep breath and [[enter the room]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="95" name="enter the room" tags="" position="5597,1648" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt; 

The faint light of your screen illuminates a small halo around you in what seems like complete and total darkness. There aren&#39;t any silhouettes of objects around you - no furniture, no old stuff, nothing at all. You turn to all directions but as far as you can tell the room is empty. And completely dark. 

It&#39;s a darkness that envelops you and sticks to your clothes, a rich and dense darkness which makes it hard to breathe and almost drowns you. Walking in a straight line you reach the wall - and indeed the windows - and examine them with increasing astonishment. They have been covered with some black and impenetrable material that makes it impossible to tell that it&#39;s actually day outside.

Raising your phone higher, you see something big and round hanging from the ceiling above. It shifts uneasily, as if irritated by the light you&#39;re pointing towards it, it&#39;s enormous leathery wings curling to protect it&#39;s head...

&#39;**Vat have you done!!!**&#39;

You turn around to the enormous figure of Ionut charging towards you at full speed.

$A[**&#39;Wait, I was ju-&#39;**]

The ground beneath you is cold and rough, the rocks painfully digging into your spine. Your entire body feels numb and heavy, as if an enormous weight was pushing you down. 

With great effort you force your eyes open and stare at the grey sky above. And the walls of earth around you.

$A[**&#39;Mhmhmhmhmhm!!!&#39;**] You try to scream, but your mouth is gagged. Ionut, towering somewhere above you, continues his work with the shovel, slowly and methodically burying your body five feet into the barren soil.

Panic sets in and you begin to struggle, trying to get out, but your(if:$dead&gt;0)[ weak, feminine] hands and feet are bound and the increasing weight of the earth on top of you is too much. Chunks of dirt fall on your chest, splattering a handful of worms on your naked body.

A bulky metal device, the generator is full of brass cylinders, cogs and pistons, topped with wires connecting to tesla coils with glass protectors and bulky silver handles. In the center is a giant round shape, the home of the dynamo that makes the whole thing work.

Much the same as the day before, the village has few places of interest.

There is the [[hunting cabin-&gt;cabin2]], but you doubt that you&#39;ll find anyone today either as the place looked pretty abandoned. There&#39;s also the [[inn-&gt;inn3]] - though you remember the welcome you received last time. Perhaps it really was closed, but most likely the owner simply didn&#39;t like you. 

$A[Maybe if I befriend one of the locals, they&#39;ll be willing to let me in.]

You take the familiar path downhill following the little stream. Perhaps the mountain air is already having a positive effect or perhaps you&#39;re getting used to the road, but this time the trip is less exhausting.

The forest around you is beautiful in an eerie way, the tall trees casting a deep shade that has stifled most of the low vegetation between them, creating a surprisingly clear space on the ground, filled mostly with lots of dry pinecones and the occasional bush.

$M[&#39;You&#39;re not going insane, just becoming a little more perceptive. Probably another side effect from the transformation. Demons are known for their low tolerance to bullshit.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Okay, okay, hold on a little. Not only have I somehow travelled through time, not only have I switched gender, but you&#39;re telling me that demons are real and that you&#39;re.... a cat?&#39;] It all sounded so steamy and angry in your head, but with your new girly voice you sound mostly puffy and a little hysterical. The difference is alarming.

$M[&#39;Of course there are demons. And don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never seen cats. All the rest are pretty much the same.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Of course I&#39;ve seen cats! I used to own a cat! And who are the rest?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Oh, it&#39;s a long list - the usual suspects, you&#39;ve read about them in old books - werewolves, vampires, banshees, creaky trunks...&#39;]

$a[&#39;Creaky trunks?! Are you fucking with- wait, vampires?&#39;]

$M[&#39;It&#39;s up to you really... though being a fool is a persistent habit. There are certain items that could help you, but I wouldn&#39;t advise it.&#39;]

There is a tingling sensation that propagates from it through your entire body, like a shockwave of a million small needles pricking your skin all the way to your fingertips. Your vision wobbles for a few seconds and then stabilizes, becoming somehow more crisp.

Trusting the cat&#39;s judgement seems slightly naive, but not trusting her is probably even worse. You&#39;ve just stepped into this wild world of creatures and magic, a world in which - you remind yourself - you didn&#39;t last more than a few days.

$a[&#39;So, now that we have this settled...&#39;]

$M[&#39;Yes, darling?&#39;] She flashes you a toothy smile.

$a[&#39;I&#39;m afraid I need some clothes. Mihai said he wanted me to be representable... and I&#39;m also a girl now.&#39;] You gulp. $a[&#39;I don&#39;t have any girl clothes.&#39;]

You stumble outside, half-expecting the town to be a hellish dungeon or a monster-infested den, but to your disappointment it turns out to be neither of those. In fact you can&#39;t spot any differences from before. 

You briefly consider lingering around to look for something unusual, but your curiosity gets the best of you and you set towards the manor at a [[brisk pace]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="124" name="Follow her" tags="shop" position="3153,161" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$ant&lt;/div&gt;

The shop, long and narrow, truly stretches inwards like the entrails of a giant beast, twisting left and right with openings occasionally appearing to either side, the weak yellowish light from the bulbs in a constant losing battle to the shadows sprouting everywhere. 

As $Felicia leads you farther along rows of jars with strange thick substances inside and shelves filled with books of every shape and size, you wonder how the architecture of the boutique is even possible. From the outside it looked like a small construction nuzzled between two houses, but it just seems to continue winding somewhere else entirely.

Eventually you reach a section where numerous dresses and overcoats are left hanging, followed by other old garments of all varieties.

$M[&#39;Hold on for a minute, I&#39;ll fetch something for you&#39;] Your green-eyed host disappears somewhere between them all.

After a bit, your friend pops out, carrying with her two sets of costumes that she hangs on a nearby rack.

$M[&#39;They&#39;re your size, my eye never lies. Pick the one that suits your style.&#39;]

You approach to examine the clothes. The first set appears to be some sort of $in[butler uniform]. $A[It would certainly fit a receptionist.] The second one is more neutral, like an old $in[gentleman&#39;s outfit].

It seems to be the most appropriate option. While you&#39;re not exactly a butler, you&#39;re part of the staff and at the service of the owner and the guests. This garment is the most befitting of your social ranking.

If Mr. Petrescu wants you to look like a real gentleman and not embarrass him in front of his (obviously important) guests, then this is surely the best option. Besides, the British practically invented the gentleman&#39;s style. Your blood demands it!

Well, why the hell not? If Mihai wants you to look fashionable and not embarrass him, why not go all the way?

Stepping out of the Antique Boutique, you&#39;re greeted with a $in[night sky and a full moon overhead.]

$A[**What the hell?!**]

You take out your phone and check the time - it&#39;s [$hour:$minute]&lt;time|. 

Your jaw drops and you feel a deep unease and vertigo. How could this be? It doesn&#39;t make any sense.

You remember distinctly entering the boutique not so long ago and it was still early! You didn&#39;t spend more than 30-40 minutes in there, maximum an hour, and yet somehow...

With a racing heart you run through the village and reach the stream. With no idea what&#39;s going on, getting back to the manor seems the best option.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/wolf.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;The road is dark and barely distinguishable, even under the full moon. If you hadn&#39;t already walked it a number of times you&#39;d be long lost. The forest, black and forbidding, is eerily quiet save for the wind blowing between the pines.

Then there is another sound - the distant howling of wolves, somewhere to the east. You&#39;re acutely aware just how dangerous this path can be at night. You should have never stayed this late at the village, but damn the time flew impossibly at the antique shop.

Suddenly you catch something with the corner of your eye, a blurry movement between the trees on the other side of the stream. Curiosity however is topped by the voice of caution  and your pace quickens, not waiting to see what is lurking about.

As you turn a corner on the road, a few hundred feet farther upstream, you see a silhouette of a man blocking the way.

With a cautious step you approach the figure, its outline becoming more unnatural and bizarre to your silent horror. When it&#39;s barely a few feet away you can see that the thing is half-human half-wolf, wearing the torn remnants of clothes through which fur and claws protrude.

It emits a low growl and you peer up straight into two flaming yellow eyes and a (link-reveal:&quot;giant drooling jaw...&quot;)[

You turn around and start running without looking back. There was something sinister and unnatural in the silhouette that you saw and you&#39;re not going to stick around to see up close what it was.

A howl tears through the night, long and piercing and, worst of all, right behind you. You switch into a sprint, running as fast as you can, but soon you can hear steps behind you, approaching fast.

You leave the clearing of the path and plunge into the forest. The trees become stranger and deader and soon enough you can barely recognize the forest.

You manage to gain some distance and can no longer hear the steps behind you, but carry on running anyways, the dead branches catching on your newly acquired outfit and tearing it up with a hundred small cuts. 

When you feel that you&#39;ve lost your pursuer, whoever it was, you finally stop to catch your breath, leaning your back behind a big mossy boulder.

Your lungs feel on fire and every breath is a pain in your chest, but at least you got away. The bad part is that the forest is utterly dark and you have no idea where you are. $A[What the hell is this place...?]

&quot;You take the familiar path downhill following the little stream. Perhaps the mountain air is already having a positive effect or perhaps you&#39;re getting used to the road, but this time the trip is less exhausting.

The forest around you is beautiful in an eerie way, the tall trees casting a deep shade that has stifled most of the low vegetation between them, creating a surprisingly clear space on the ground, filled mostly with lots of dry pinecones and the occasional bush.&quot;,
&quot;The doors of the hatch take some effort to lift but you eventually manage to open them, removing the vines that have already started to crawl on top.

The inside of the basement is more akin to the opening of a dungeon, with a cold stony floor and pillars supporting the manor on top. There are matches left near the hatch and you use them to light a torch which illuminates well enough the space several feet around you.

There are pipes and valves covering most of the east wall and going into the ceiling, as well as a handful of crates, a workbench and some tools hanging near it, more torches and cobwebs wobbling by the cold draft; and of course, there is the generator.

On the opposite side of the room there is another door leading further down...&quot;,
&quot;With a hungry stomach, you enter the dining hall and are greeted with a strange sight. All the windows have been covered with heavy wooden shutters from the exterior, such that barely any sunlight enters the room at all. To compensate for this, candles have been lit on almost all of the tables, their faint flames doing little but pushing the darkness a couple of feet away.

Sitting on a large ornate table not far from the entrance, you recognise the silhouette of a man with a golden cane.

&#39;Ah, Mr. Reid. Coming for some breakfast?&#39;

&#39;Yes, I was hungry... pardon my curiosity, Mr. Petrescu&#39; - you decide to lean on the side of caution when addressing your boss - &#39;but what is all this?&#39;

&#39;Just having breakfast with an old friend, no cause for worry. It&#39;s much more romantic this way, don&#39;t you find?&#39; Something in his tone implies that disagreement is not really an option.

&#39;Yes, of course, Mr. Petre-&#39;

&#39;Although it would be better with the grand chandelier&#39; - he points upwards towards a heavy ball of light bulbs and crystals - &#39;but unfortunately the power is still down. Speaking of which, have you any intention of going down to the village today?&#39;&quot;,
&quot;&#39;Eggs and bakon, ja?&#39;

You give him a nod and he disappears again, followed by the sound of sizzling.

A few minutes later, while you&#39;re eating in the semi-complete darkness of the dining hall, a new silhouette enters the room. You immediately identify the bizarre outline of the woman you met earlier. She takes a seat across the table from Mihai, occupying what appears to be the biggest armchair you&#39;ve ever seen, with a seat large enough for two people to sit on side by side comfortably and a tall back covered in numerous fancy cushions. Her slim body and small round head look almost ridiculous in comparison, yet somehow she seems to fill the chair quite nicely with the rest of her body...

Looking at her you start getting a headache and you move your gaze away, rubbing your tired eyes. The room is so dark and the candles so faint that the shadows are starting to play tricks on you.. Bits of the conversation make their way to you, but it&#39;s too low and jumbled to make any sense.&quot;,
&quot; To your surprise, one of the doors on your right opens and a woman walks out in the hallway, walking towards you without a sound. She is tall and dark - her skin and short hair black as ebony. However what is most peculiar about her are her proportions - as she advances you can see the outline of  her body: her head is small and thin, and her stick-like arms flail around her equally skeletal torso which, if it has breasts at all, hides them very well under a tight leather jacket. And still despite this slim and skinny upper section, under her waist her body bulges out into an entirely different shape: her ass - round and protruding - is almost a separate entity altogether, occupying - you genuinely wonder - almost as much space as the rest of her.        &quot;,
&quot;You leave your room and head instinctively towards the staircase, when a cold breeze brushes an icy finger on your cheek. You look both ways - all the windows are closed - but after all this is a pretty old house... 

Suddenly, you&#39;re feeling a little curious to explore the top floor. Both Mihai and Ionut were very brief about it, and you wonder if there aren&#39;t some hidden delights to find - perhaps an opening to the roof? Surely the view to the mountain will be breathtaking. And then there are the towers... you could always take a peek around.      &quot;,
&quot;You wake up full of energy and ready to take on the world! Despite the limited commodities, you had a good night&#39;s sleep and are looking forward to your first day of work. 

...which starts at  6pm. In your enthusiasm you&#39;d almost forgotten. Still, you&#39;ll probably find something useful to do during the day!    &quot;,

You slowly wake up, your eyes opening to the familiar view of your room&#39;s ceiling. The dark mist in your mind slowly disperses and is replaced with mounting confusion.

$A[What was that....? A dream..? Hallucination? Drugs? How the hell am I alive? It was all so real...]

You rise in your bed and toss the covers aside. There is an immediate and profound sensation that something is off. Then apprehension strikes - your body is different. Smaller waist; leaner, hairless legs; you raise up your hands - they&#39;re similar, but definitely different - smaller, more delicate; your gaze falls down on a pair of mounds bulging your pyjamas.

You shoot out of bed and into the small bathroom attached to your chamber, where a strange new face is looking at you in the mirror. 

Well, some of it is not new - your eyes are the same, dark brown, unchanged; your hair is almost the same, dark straight, though perhaps longer. 

You concentrate on your features - they have shifted around in slight but important ways, crafting the face of a young, beautiful woman staring with an open jaw and wide, terrified eyes.

Stumped in shock, you fall a few steps back.

Thinking is hard and as you clutch your head with both hands your thoughts buzz inside like a swarm of angry wasps, too fast and dangerous to catch. Minutes pass until you manage to calm down your beating heart. Your gaze absent-mindedly falls on the bracelet on your hand and the (colour:&quot;#FFCCCC&quot;)[four crimson beads] that decorate it.

$A[Alright, Alex.. what&#39;s going on? Did I take any drugs? Did someone slip me something?] 

You let the confusion wash over you for a few minutes, then your rational mind kicks in. $A[This is real.] You pinch your thigh and the pain reaches your brain, sobering it up. 

$A[I&#39;m Alex, I was a student, I grew up with my parents in England...] 

A wave of new and confusing memories swirls around your head, but you chase them away. 

$A[...and then I travelled to Romania for a summer job. I&#39;m currently in a hotel in a village located high in the mountains above Timisoara.] 

You look down at the two small bumps on your chest currently covered by your pyjamas. 

$A[...and apparently somehow, for some reason, I have become a girl.] 

You try to think very hard about the last thing you remember, but your recollection from last night is vague at best. 

$A[Given the irrefutable weight of reality, I must allow the possibility that the supernatural exists and it has affected me in some way. In some very peculiar way indeed...]

The shock subsiding, you look down at your changed body again, with a pique of curiosity. Ignoring the circumstances of the event, it is quite the extraordinary experience.

All around, the room is littered with bones of various shapes and sizes, all gnawed to a clean white. Beside them lay the corpses of smaller animals, sucked dry and shriveled as if there remained nothing but a layer of skin covered by dry fur.

Your attention shifts back to yourself - laying on your back, body wrapped in a cocoon neck to toes, with only your head sticking out to breathe.

It is a strange feeling, walking down the mountain trail all by yourself. Even when the sun is high up, there is a darkness between the trees that cannot be dispersed. (if: $lastdeath is &quot;wolf&quot;)[

Eerie images flash in your mind and send shivers down your spine. You can&#39;t quite recall what happened, but the trees are there and you can smell your own fear in the air.] You feel vulnerable walking alone, even more so than before. 

$A[There are all sorts of things that could happen to a young girl walking alone through the woods...] your sweat feels cold, but your skin is strangely hot.

The shop, long and narrow, truly stretches inwards like the entrails of a giant beast, twisting left and right with openings occasionally appearing to either side, the weak yellowish light from the bulbs in a constant losing battle to the shadows sprouting everywhere. 

You vaguely remember this part and move through the motions, following your friend deep into the belly of her shop.


Eventually you reach a section where numerous dresses and overcoats are left hanging, followed by other old garments of all varieties.

$M[&#39;Hold on for a minute sweetie, I&#39;ll fetch a few things for you&#39;] She disappears somewhere between the rows.

You sit on an old box and wait for the [[woman to return]].

$M[&#39;They&#39;re your size, my eye never lies. Pick the one that suits your style.&#39;]

It seems to be the most appropriate option. While you&#39;re not exactly a butler, you&#39;re part of the staff and at the service of the owner and the guests. This garment is the most befitting of your social ranking. Plus, the other option certainly doesn&#39;t look like something you would dare wear in public.

The shop owner observes your hesitation with quiet amusement. You can feel her green eyes on you and you start to sweat a little. 

You reach for the skirt and then **stop** mid-way, turning towards the butler&#39;s uniform.

$a[&#39;I&#39;ll have that one.&#39;]

The room is exactly as you remember it. The sheets on the bed, the curtains on the windows, the tablecloth, even the carpet is made from a silvery silky-smooth material that gives the place an overall light-greyish tone. It feels like stepping in some eerie dream.

You step uncertainly on the $str[silky web]silver carpet, glancing at the $str[bones]sticks littered around the room. The nausea mounts in your throat and hits you like a truck. You fall to your knees.

$A[What the hell...]

You see yourself, $str[cocooned]tied on the bed, a giant silhouette of a black $str[spider]woman behind you, $str[descending from the ceiling]coming out of the wardrobe. Your constrained figure moans, half-unconscious, as the $str[spider]woman pushes something inside her and $str[starts laying its eggs]pushes her fingers inside you.

Without you noticing your hand has darted down between your legs, your fingers rubbing vigorously the wetness between your folds. 
It&#39;s something that you&#39;ve never done before.
No.
You&#39;ve done it hundreds of times. 
The memories come rushing to your head. As a little girl, rubbing yourself under the sheets, hoping no one would see you; as a teenager, home alone, browsing the dark side of Wumblr and fantasizing you&#39;d run off with your own billionaire sadist; as a liberal in college, finally ordering all those toys you&#39;d always wanted and stockpiling on batteries for the lonely weekends at the dormitories.

There is a sound like a low growl, and a dog sniffing the air...

The book is old, but well preserved. On the cover, instead of a title, is writen in big, gothic numbers &quot;20-06-1763&quot;. You open a random page and find an odd, unrecognisable language:

What is really odd however is not the unfamiliar language, but the fact that however neatly, the book is clearly written by hand, the occasional ink dot punctuating the otherwise flawless calligraphy.

You place the book back and take another one, titled &quot;05-03-1648&quot;, only to find the same mysterious language and identical almost perfect handwriting. 

$A[It&#39;s rather unusual to find manuscripts these days... is this a family record? But then if it was some form of ancient Romanian, I would have been able to pick up at least a couple of words. Interesting.]

The dates stretch back a few hundred years at least, from what you can tell. The most recent title is &quot;02-01-1945&quot; and after that the records stop. There are, however, a number of untitled books waiting on the shelf.

The book is completely blank, its white grainy paper giving off a peculiar scent as you flip through the pages. It feels nice to the touch, as if inviting you to grab a quill and write down something on it.

You glance at the shelf - $A[There are a dozen more empty books, nobody would notice one missing..]

When you enter the dining hall the room is already prepared, white table cloths with candlesticks covering all tables. Through the windows you can see the darkness beyond the manor, only the full moon&#39;s shadow peeking through the dirty glass.

Looking around, the place is completely desolate. You can&#39;t see any guests in sight.

$A[Ionut mentioned that there are only two guests at the moment, but this is still a little sad. Are they not hungry, or just busy elsewhere?]

On a table close to the window, Mihai is sitting alone, a glass of wine in his hand but no plate infront. He is the only person in the room. When he sees you he beckons you forward, gesturing a chair across from him.

You smirk and take the bait, sitting on the designated chair. There&#39;s nobody else around anyways, so you might as well talk to the eccentric owner. 

$Mi[So, Mr Reid, how do you find my hotel? Is it everything that you had hoped for?] Mihai&#39;s deep voice bears only the slightest of foreign accents, resembling more the intonation of a 19th century earl. Even now his golden headed cane is with him, leaning casually on the side of his chair.

You shake your head politely, raising your hands in an improvised gesture of apology. The owner nods dryly and doesn&#39;t insist.

$A[What an eccentric guy..]

Drinking wine alone in an empty hall may seem classy, but you suspect its just part of the façade that Mihai puts up to make his hotel more attractive to tourists. No doubt he expects you tell tales of the haunted manor and mysterious owner when you get back home, hopefully fooling some of your friends and relatives into checking out the place. Now that you think about it quite a few of the guys you know are gullible enough to at least hope there would be ghosts around the place, and no doubt the owner has arranged the occasional strange noise at night to keep the visitors coming...

All in all the place is quite inspiring for the right kind of person, if you forget for a moment that it&#39;s all just a front. With grim cynicism you dig into your dinner which Ionut has brought discretely on your table.

$a[&#39;There&#39;s clearly more to it than meets the eye&#39;] - you smile at the owner knowingly - $a[&#39;such an ancient manor full of history and mysteries is clearly the sign of a dynasty that goes back many generations. I looked around a bit and I can&#39;t help but be very impressed.&#39;]

You draw in a deep breath. $a[&#39;Your library is rich and the books in it are authentic, from what I can tell. Your family portraits are numerous and masterfully crafted, especially for the periods when they were drawn. This gives away your noble roots.&#39;]

Mihai nods but doesn&#39;t say anything.

$a[&#39;The building itself is more complex than is expected from a simple hotel, and I have no doubt that the towers that rise on top hold many family secrets. One even might wonder, Mr Petrescu, if your livelihood truly comes from guest fees...&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;I shall let you draw your own conclusions, Mr. Reid.&#39;]

You see no reason to lie, so you tell Lavius about your job at The Crooked Elm, giving him a brief overview of how you wound up here. He listens to your story, sipping wine from his glass.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/Lav0.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;

You&#39;re spared from coming up with a reply since the waiter brings the bottle of wine and Lavius pours you a full glass of it.

$L[&#39;A worthy enterprise! I immediately knew you were a woman of culture! Let&#39;s drink to that!&#39;]

The wine has a strong and rich taste, a mixture of sour sweetness, a fruity aftertaste and something else, unrecognisable.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/Lav0.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt; 
$L[&#39;Do you like it?&#39;]

$a[&#39;It&#39;s really good!&#39;] The wine is indeed delicious and you finish the glass quickly. Lavius gives you a radiant smile.

The second glass tastes somehow even better than the first one and before you know it Lavius is sitting next to you, chattering about the anecdotal misadventures of the village buffoons.

$L[&#39;You should have seen them, Alexandra, 3 grown men chasing a pig inside this very inn, and before they could catch it, it drank half their beers!&#39;]

You laugh together, banging your fists on the table. Lavius casually wraps a hand around your waist, pulling you closer. A happy warmth is spreading through your entire body - you haven&#39;t felt that good in ages.

$L[&#39;Ah, that bottle was simply amazing! We should order a second one, it&#39;s on me!&#39;] He waves at the waiter and soon enough your glasses are full again.

&#39;There&#39;s something strange that I&#39;ve noticed about the bracelet&#39; you say, lifting your wrist for the shop owner to see.

&#39;When you gave it to me, I can quite distinctly remember there being **5 crimson beads** on top of it. However the following day there were **only 4**. And now there are **$bcharges**.&#39;

You raise en eyebrow towards the woman.

$M[&#39;Quite so. A keen observation - like I told you, this is a demonic bracelet. It holds the power to protect its bearer from death. That power, however, is not unlimited. The crimson beads on top of it show you the number of times it can be used.&#39;]

&#39;So this means...&#39;

$M[&#39;Exactly. If there are only dark beads left, when you die - you die.&#39;(if: $bcharges is 0)[Sadly, this appears to be the case.&#39;] (elseif: $bcharges is 1)[But you have at least 1 left. That is good.&#39;] (elseif: $bcharges&gt;1)[But for now you should be fine.&#39;] ]

&#39;Is there- is there any way to recharge it?&#39; You swallow hard.

$M[&#39;Of course there is! Don&#39;t be silly - who&#39;d go through all the trouble of making a demonic bracelet - a rare, powerful and not to mention expensive artefact - if you couldn&#39;t even recharge it!&#39;  ]

$M[&#39;You need to devour the *energia vitalis* of a willing victim.&#39;]

$M[&#39;The energy can&#39;t come from **you**, silly, that wouldn&#39;t make any sense!&#39;] Her eyes tingle with amusement. 

&#39;But I-  I mean - there isn&#39;t anyone-&#39;

$M[&#39;Oh, I&#39;m sure a pretty girl such as yourself will surely have no trouble recharging her bracelet. It doesn&#39;t have to be a man, mind you, though you do need your victim to climax.&#39;]

&#39;Oh! Wait, if it doesn&#39;t have to be a man, then does that mean-&#39;

$M[&#39;Nope, forget about it.&#39;]

&#39;But I might **literally die!!**&#39;

The woman gives you a steel look, all the whimsical joy evaporating from her eyes. For a moment you see her irises stretch vertically, the shadows gathering around her...

Her slim body and small round head look almost ridiculous in comparison, yet somehow she seems to fill the chair quite nicely with the rest of her body...

The arachnid woman converses with Mihai, and even though you don&#39;t know the details of it, you can imagine the broad strokes. A home for her offspring. A host she can lay her eggs into.

Your blood chills while at the same time a certain part of your body grows hotter. You struggle to continue eating calmly.

After your death the real game begins. You wake up as a woman (side effect of the bracelet) and start realizing you&#39;re in some shit. The goal of the game is to complete the day without dying (which is not easy to do). Each time you die your bracelet loses life charges and if you reach 0 it&#39;s game over.

You sit patiently on the table, waiting for Lavius to get back. You feel hot and sweaty, your mind in a happy haze from the wine. While you wait for your generous friend to return you sip nonchalantly from the expensive wine he bought for you. $A[&#39;Damn, this is a nice life!&#39;]

After a few minutes, he returns.

$L[&#39;I&#39;m terribly sorry for the interruption my dear, my *friend* over there needed my immediate council on a private matter. But I shan&#39;t bother you with such trifles. Now, where were we?&#39;]

Lavius leans in and kisses you again, filling your mouth with the taste of wine, lavender and something else, unrecognisable. When he draws away, you can&#39;t help but get a feeling of void.

$L[&#39;Let&#39;s finish the wine, shall we?&#39;]

The two of you finish the rest of the wine between more jokes and kisses. When the bottle is empty he takes your hand and leads you outside.

You have to admit that you&#39;re not paying too much attention where you&#39;re going, but after a while you leave the village and walk a short way towards the forest, after which the familiar silhouette of the $in[hunting cabin] appears among the trees. $L[&#39;We&#39;re almost there my love.&#39;]

You look around surprised. There are no other buildings in sight.

$a[&#39;Lavius, I didn&#39;t take you for a hunter!&#39;]

$L[&#39;A hunter? I am also that I suppose.&#39;] - he addresses you a strange grin. $L[&#39;But the place where we&#39;re going is not inside the cabin, but *beneath* it. Come, darling.&#39;] 

Wrapping a hand around your shoulders Lavius leads you around the cabin. The backside is just a dull wooden wall with no distinguishable markings. Your companion approaches the left corner and grabs one small twig sticking from the planks and gently twists it around. A portion of the wall caves in and slides away, opening to a flight of stone stairs descending somewhere into the darkness. Reaching a hand inside, he flips something with a loud *click!* and a row of lamps lights up, illuminating the passage with a yellow glow.

$A[Electricity!] Something inside your mind stirs, but you&#39;re too drunk to pay much attention to it.

$L[&#39;Welcome to my lair, love&#39;] says lavius, taking you by the hand and [[leading you down.-&gt;drunk 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="262" name="drunk 3" tags="lab0 lavius" position="5905,6664" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$lav&lt;/div&gt;

After a couple dozen steps the staircase ends with a heavy wooden door that Lavius pushes open. You step into a long hallway with a handful of doors to each side. There are more of the lamps spraying dirty yellow light around. Copper pipes run the length of the ceiling, punctuated with valves and pressure gauges. 

$L[&#39;Welcome to my secret laboratory!&#39;]

$a[&#39;It won&#39;t be secret for long if you invite every girl to visit&#39;] you chuckle.

$L[&#39;Perhaps, perhaps not&#39;] he replies with a mischievous smile.

$a[&#39;And what&#39;s to stop from just anyone barging in anyways?&#39;] you ask, strolling down the hallway.

$L[&#39;First of all, nobody knows where it is. And even if somehow they did, how would they get out once they&#39;re in? Nobody knows that the password is Lastra Mora&#39;]
$sc4[
$sys[You have learned a new secret: The Password]
(set: $secrets to (it +1)) ($nSecret: &quot;The Password&quot;) (set: $sc4 to false)]
$a[&#39;Good of you tell me.&#39;] You approach one of the doors - it has a small round window through which you can see a variety of chemical instruments and concoctions. $a[&#39;What is all this, anyways?&#39;]

$L[&#39;Ah, my dear, it is nothing that fits the tastes of a lady such as yourself. Come.&#39;] He takes your hand again and leads you down the hallway through several doors and down another flight of stairs. At the end of your short walk you end up in front of a large violet door with a golden handle.

$L[&#39;Shall we, my dear?&#39;]

You press the handle and enter a small room, dimly lit by candles. It is furbished in a lavish and extravagant style, with silk and paintings, a stark contrast from the gloomy corridor you just left. And of course the biggest feature is the the king-sized bed in the middle, a glass of red wine already waiting on the night stand.

$a[&#39;So is this your-&#39;]

Not letting you finish, Lavius kisses you again, passionately, his lips stealing the breath from your lungs. It&#39;s a long kiss, a demanding kiss that takes everything you&#39;ve got and gives nothing back. Your body grows even hotter, lust flaring between your legs. He pushes you onto the bed.

You land flat on your back, the satin sheets cushioning your fall. He is on top of you, kissing your lips, kissing your neck, kissing your breasts, his hands tearing apart your clothes as he descends lower in a flurry of desire.

$a[&#39;What are you-&#39;]

He silences you with another brute kiss, completely shredding your $suit to pieces. Your naked body glistens in the darkness, beads of sweat covering your skin. Lavius runs his hands along it, feeling every curve. Reaching your arms, he places them in an outstretched position above your head and you soon feel the soft touch of leather wrapping around your wrists.

$A[Oooh, kinky!]

A fleeting hesitation crosses your mind. Should you really be doing this? You&#39;ve barely just met.

You giggle and relax your body, letting him tie first your hands and then your legs, pulling them apart. You feel completely defenceless and exposed, your flower twitching as he stares hungrily at it. $A[Maybe this is exactly what I wanted...]

He bends down and kisses it, leaving a trail of saliva along your slit. You feel that you can&#39;t resist him anymore. $A[Just take me already!]

Slowly, Lavius undresses in front of you. In the darkness you can&#39;t see much, but his body is clearly lean and muscular. When he&#39;s done he approaches you, sitting on the bed in front of you and wrapping his strong arms under your legs. 

You feel a finger run along your wet slit.

He silences you with another kiss, gently caressing your hair as he does. You relax again, giving in to his seduction. He binds your legs as well, pulling them apart. You feel completely defenceless and exposed, your flower twitching as he stares hungrily at it.

$M[&#39;I&#39;ll admit he has his weaknesses, mostly for young naive girls that wonder into our village. That doesn&#39;t happen particularly often, so he has to jump on the fresh opportunity, lest it escapes him.&#39;]

A cold breeze touches your cheek. The mountain pines rustle in the distance. Despite the morbid scenery, this is a moment of respite, a moment that allows you to gather your thoughts and reflect on the situation.

You fall down in a slight surprise, your small figure nesting comfortably on the large man&#39;s knees. Up close you are able to peer under the hood, seeing a broad, weathered face with a  short stubby beard and a wide smile revealing a pair of golden teeth. He places a large hand on your hip, a casual gesture that nevertheless ensures that you won&#39;t be going anywhere unless he lets you.

His hand reaches underneath your garments and pulls your panties down. A silent gasp escapes your lips as you feel a finger brush along your slit. Your eyes circle around, meeting the amused gazes of the other men. Something tells you they know exactly what&#39;s going on but you&#39;re unable to break eye contact even as the fingers dig deeper and your breathing becomes hot and steamy.

The humiliation of being touched in front of all these men drives you crazy and you feel your flower grow wet and hungry from the older man&#39;s caresses.

The group leader wraps his arms around your body, holding you tight as he begins thrusting inside you. Your $breasts bounce up and down with every motion. Your breaths come in short. Some of the other customers in the inn are also turning their heads now, but only for a second. This only makes you wetter.

After a minute or two of this the pace accelerates and then he grows still in an instant, his throbbing cock emptying a warm puddle inside your belly. 

Another bead on the bracelet blossoms in crimson.

(if: $bcharges &gt;0)[The bracelet emits a reassuring warmth on your wrist. It still has $bcharges crimson bead(if: $bcharges&gt;1)[s] left on it. 

$A[Even if things go terribly wrong, I should be fine...]

You shake your head and pull yourself together. $A[I&#39;m with Zach now, everything should be fine.] You  reach for the barely noticeable twig sticking out of the left corner of the wall and twist it downwards. A portion of the wall slides open, (link-reveal:&quot;revealing the hidden staircase.&quot;)[ 
(change: ?page,(bg:&quot;https://xfiction.org/images/tr/environments/cabin_back_open.jpg&quot;))
$z[&#39;Woow!&#39;]

The tunnel is dark and foreboding, but the switch on the wall is easy enough to spot. As soon as you press it the electric lights flicker on, making the entrance easy to navigate though no less sinister.

$z[&#39;I&#39;ve always wondered where the little bastard disappears. I guess he relies on  keeping it secret rather than any conventional security. How did you find this place anyway?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I-- eh, I happened to be walking around in the forest when he went in.&#39;] you lie to Zach. The guy seems nice but you&#39;re not ready to share your secret with him.

$z[&#39;Talk about beginner&#39;s luck... many people have been looking for his hideout for years. Now some girl shows up and stumbles upon the entrance. Fate really is cruel.&#39;]

$A[My fate was cruel too..] you think to yourself.

$A[I guess he was counting on nobody actually finding this place... I was expecting tougher security measures.]

Amidst the piles of machinery and unknown contraptions, there is one which immediately grasps your attention. The source of the humming is a large metal cylinder with various buttons and levers, with wires branching out to the other devices and out of the room. It is unmistakably an electrical generator. A few feet away from it there is a group of metal barrels with flammable stickers on them.

With a deep sigh you leave the barrel on the ground. You were so close!

Returning to the main hallway, you hear a faint noise coming from the depths of the laboratory, like voices calling out, though it&#39;s hard to make out over the electric buzz of the old yellow bulbs. A cold shiver runs through your spine and you feel the goosebumps crawling on your skin.

$A[Stay calm, Alexandra, you can do this!]

Unfortunately for you, the big exit door is now **closed**. $A[What the hell?!] You reach out to pull it open, only to discover that there is no handle on the inside. You run your hands along the smooth surface, searching in vain for buttons or hidden mechanisms. There aren&#39;t any.

Just when panic starts to invade your brain and your heart is pounding in your chest, you notice a small digital screen with a small keyboard on the side of the door.

You carefully type $I[&quot;Lastra Mora&quot;] on the keypad. The device beeps a couple of times and the door slowly creaks open accompanied by the sound of hidden pneumatics.

$A[Phew! For a moment I was quite worried...]

The way back up is no less sinister as the first time but after a short while you reach the fake wall and with the push of a button it slides away, revealing the clear sky.

A cheeky smile appears on your lips. $a[&#39;I want to rob Lavius.&#39;]

You ignore the question and walk up to the leader confidently, lewdly swaying your hips. You bend over the table, reaching for a mug on the opposite end. You take a small sip and wink at the man who was drinking from it. The leader, right behind you, gives off a small chuckle as he examines the view offered by your lack of underwear.

He continues to prod you for a while, until your face grows red and you begin to moan softly. Then he unzips his pants and pulls you back in his lap, where you collapse on top of his already erect member.

The need overtakes you again and you begin bouncing up and down on your own, much to the men&#39;s amusement. The leader reaches and pulls your breasts out, allowing them to jiggle freely as you ride his cock.

$A[Why does this feel so damn good?] you ask yourself as you feel his cock stiffen inside you and you push back to get it as deep as possible inside you while he delivers his load.

Another bead on the bracelet blossoms in crimson.

$Felicia grins widely. $M[&#39;I give you the flask for free.... but you&#39;ll settle one of my debts&#39;]

There is a hungry and mischievous glimmer in her eyes, like she&#39;s almost begging you to accept the bargain. Something tells you that learning 5 secrets will be safer to do... but you also need those pheromones badly.

It&#39;s not a conscious decision at first, but your feet take you closer and closer towards the silhouette until you can clearly see one another. 

The creature looks like some sort of feral man, hunched and mutated, with a hairy body and long, sharp claws on his hands. He cocks his head to the side as it eyes you up and down. You can hear him sniff the air intently, his body tensing and ready for action.

You&#39;re close enough that the smell hits you, a bestial smell of sweat and mucus that is both repulsive and attractive in its repulsiveness. Your body responds to it with a growing hotness an a light-headed feeling that borders on euphoria.

The creature takes a step towards you and your eyes fall down to its giant erection. $A[This is bad!! If I don&#39;t do something, that thing is probably going to tear my clothes to shreds and take me, I mean rape me...]

In the few heartbeats you have to react, you take the only logical way out by dropping to your knees and offering the beast your open $lips. It doesn&#39;t wait for an invitation and sticks its member inside your mouth, grasping your hair with its abnormally large hands.

$A[Woah...]

You stare mesmerised at your breasts. They&#39;re small and cute, reminding you of an Asian girl that was once in your class. Your nipples are dark and... sensitive, you observe, touching them lightly with the tip of your index finger.

You trace a hand on your flat belly, admiring the softness of the skin.

Your gaze falls down, following the train of thought. You can tell that something you&#39;ve grown used to is missing, though there is a new, alien sensation in its place.

As a student, (link:&quot;you&quot;)[(goto:&quot;You&quot;)] have decided to take a gap year to see the world and get a better sense of what you want in life. 

After some searching you stumble upon an add in the paper that offers the job of a receptionist at a hotel in a small mountain Village in Romania.

You pack your bags and head on a long trip, eventually crossing over Europe and arriving at your destination.

Getting off the bus, you look around. The village itself is very small - barely a few dozen stone houses at best. The mountain air is clean and fresh, filling your nostrils with the scent of old pines and green moss. Save for a few electric lamps barely illuminating the street, it doesn’t look very modern. Judging by the architectural style, it hasn&#39;t moved in the last few centuries. 

Unable to locate the hotel, you talk to a strange man who sends you upwards a mountain trail, going along the river. The path is steep and it&#39;s getting dark, but after an hour of walking, you eventually arrive.

The hotel is an ancient manor several stories high, a central part and two wings with several towers and balconies looming over the mournful garden. It’s hard to make out everything in the darkness, but you estimate it has at least two dozen guest rooms, perhaps more. 

$A[Wow... the place must have been a real luxury resort back in the day, perhaps then the village was a popular tourist destination? A shame, now it reeks of disuse and decay... Could be a cool place to stay, but I doubt they get many visitors.

On the bright side, my job as a receptionist is probably going to be a whole lot of sitting around, waiting and doing nothing. Perhaps I could go back down to the village and find a pub, befriend the locals? Or maybe get back to that book I&#39;ve always wanted to write?] 

There is a fence around it, with a gate that is locked. You shout out but nobody answers.

You know that the man behind is the mysterious individual that was sitting at the table in the corner. (if: $myst_visited is 1)[You try not to stare at the man, your cheeks flaring from your recent encounter. What&#39;s even more embarrassing is that he doesn&#39;t even acknowledge your presence, focusing entirely on his conversation with Lavius.

$L[&#39;I&#39;ll be right back, my darling, don&#39;t go anywhere.&#39;] Lavius kisses you again and gets up from the table, following the other man. 

If you want to back off from your plan, now&#39;s the time.

You sit patiently on the table, waiting for Lavius to get back. You feel hot and sweaty, your mind in a happy haze from the wine. 

$A[Keep it straight, Alex, you&#39;re doing this for a reason...]

After a few minutes, he returns.

$L[&#39;I&#39;m terribly sorry for the interruption my dear, my *friend* over there needed my immediate council on a private matter. But I shan&#39;t bother you with such trifles. Now, where were we?&#39;]

Lavius leans in and kisses you again, filling your mouth with the taste of wine, lavender and something else, unrecognisable. When he draws away, you can&#39;t help but get a feeling of void.

$L[&#39;Let&#39;s finish the wine at my place, shall we?&#39;]

You make your way out the inn and to the hunting cabin, sharing more sweet nothings and kisses along the way.

When Lavius reveals his secret lair you gush with a surprised voice, counting on the wine to cover your bad acting. The two of you go down the staircase and through the heavy wooden door. 

You step into a long hallway with a handful of doors to each side. There are more of the lamps spraying dirty yellow light around. Copper pipes run the length of the ceiling, punctuated with valves and pressure gauges. 

$L[&#39;Welcome to my secret laboratory!&#39;]

$A[It won&#39;t be so secret for long ....] you think, but just chuckle politely. 

$a[&#39;And what&#39;s to stop from just anyone barging in anyways?&#39;] you ask, strolling down the hallway.

$L[&#39;First of all, nobody knows where it is. And even if somehow they did, how would they get out once they&#39;re in? Nobody knows that the password is $I[**Lastra Mora**]&#39;]

If there&#39;s any chance you were about to walk out of here alive, it&#39;s gone now. You decide to roll with it and make the best out of the situation.

He takes your hand and leads you to his private chamber. The room evokes memories of lust and doom in your mind and your heart begins to race, anticipating what is to come.

$L[&#39;You don&#39;t need this anymore, do you?&#39;] teases Lavius, sliding a hand under your $suit and pulling it off. His movements are starting to become more forceful and dominant. As you stand in front of him, completely naked, he licks his lips, the hunger in his eyes beginning to shine through the thinly veiled facade.

$L[&#39;Put your hands on the wall, dear Alexandra,&#39;] he says, an edge creeping in his voice. 

He begins to slowly unbutton his shirt, revealing a thin, muscular chest with pale white skin. $L[&#39;What are you waiting for? Do it!&#39;]

The beast enters you with a growl, stretching you wide with a single thrusts. He&#39;s too big, way too big for you, and you immediately realize that your human body could never safely handle anything of this size.

You are surprised to find out that you&#39;re wrong. Your flesh stretches and adapts with unnatural ease, letting the werewolf&#39;s giant phallus plunge deep inside you.

$M[&#39;You can&#39;t just drink it, that&#39;s for sure. But I can use it to make various items that may prove beneficial.&#39;]

You peer into the poisonous green bottle. If it is what you think it is, you could just pour it into someone&#39;s glass...

&#39;What can you make of it?&#39; you ask the owner.

$M[&#39;The easy option would be to use it as an enhancer in a standard amulet. The amulet can absorb the benefits of the potion - speed and strength - and grant them to you in a milder, safer, and more permanent way. If I add a little extra, it might even last through your death...&#39;]

&#39;Oh wow! So I will permanently become very nimble?&#39;

$M[&#39;Effectively, yes. You will be quicker, more enduring, and with improved reactions in certain situations.&#39;]

&#39;Certainly sounds useful. But you mentioned this was the &quot;easy&quot; option. What else can you make out of it?&#39;

$M[&#39;There are a few things, but I&#39;m currently missing the ingredients. I&#39;ll try to look around and we&#39;ll talk then.&#39;]

Felicia holds the green bottle in her hand.

$M[&#39;Right now, I can either use this to make an amulet of quickness, or you can keep it for later. 

However, to make the amulet of quickness, I will need additional ingredients, and they won&#39;t come for free. I think **2 secrets** should cover it.

You feel like the cat is driving a hard bargain, but having that amulet might just be worth it. Reluctantly, you hand it over and whisper two of your secrets to her.

Her expression remains neutral as ever, not giving away anything. 

$A[Did she already know this? What games is she playing?]

You are left with more questions than answers, as usual. The owner smiles mysteriously and leaves you to wait, disappearing somewhere in the depths of her shop. 

There is an eerie sensation of time stretching and condensing, like a bubble gum being chewed by a lazy panther. You have no idea where that mental image came from, but for some reason it sticks in your head. The minutes stretch, thick like honey, and the hours flow, quick like a mountain stream.

After 5 minutes, according to the mechanical clock on the wall, the antique boutique regurgitates its owner back to the reception.

$M[&#39;This is for you,&#39;] the cat says, handing you a small metal amulet on a string. It looks like a golden spider, with a green gem in the middle. $M[&#39;You can decide when to wear it and take it off.&#39;]

The worst thing is that you know what&#39;s going to happen. Somehow, you are still present. Not truly awake, but not deep in the endless darkness like last time. This time, you can still think, slowly and hazily. You can still feel your body, with vague and muffled sensations, as if it&#39;s a distant memory, something that happened a long time ago, far away.

You feel Elise&#39;s presence too, in the darkness of your mind&#39;s eye. The long thin legs dangling around you, her imposing body looming somewhere above. 

Your movement ceases and you know you have arrived at your final destination. You feel a small opening being torn at the back of your cocoon, and the spidery presence abruptly draws closer.

$a[&#39;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s really up to something,&#39;] you offer tentatively. $a[&#39;If anything, I think she&#39;s... alone.

$E[&#39;Tsk. Do you think we can just let humans like you learn everything about us?&#39;]

You try to thread carefully with your next words.

$a[&#39;She isn&#39;t like you, Elise. You are big and strong, and you are cunning... you can take care of anyone that tries to get in your way.&#39;]

Elise seems flattered by your words.

$E[&#39;I guess you are right... when you are something as soft and squishy as a human or a cat, I guess we can be gracious and allow some minor mischief...&#39;]

You seem to have pacified Elise, at least for now.

$E[&#39;Thank you for being honest with me, girl. Now I understand why you were able to see me. But perhaps it would be better for everyone if I made a few changes.&#39;]

Your vision tilts and a familiar silvery fog washes over your mind. You blink fast, trying to shake off the wave of confusion. Suddenly, a female silhouette is standing in front of you, her green spectacles reflecting a light that doesn&#39;t exist.

Elise considers this.

The spider&#39;s gaze narrows on you.

You stare back at the giant spider. The last bit about Mihai was a lie, but you already know that the owner of The Crooked Elm has a number of strange connections. Your bluff might just hold up.

$E[&#39;I see...&#39;] Elise&#39;s fangs twitch slightly as the giant spider looms over you. $E[&#39;One last question, young succubus. Is your presence here related to a certain cat?&#39;]

There is an edge to Elise&#39;s voice that makes you think carefully about your answer.

The ovipositor prods your body and for a moment it seems to hesitate where to go, but then it settles on your back entrance. The thin tube-like organ presses down and easily overcomes the resistance of your relaxed muscles, sliding inside you.

You realize that part of you is anticipating the action. Whether it is the spider venom or your perverted mind, you&#39;re almost looking forward to it. 

It&#39;s comforting to know that it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s not your fault that you&#39;re enjoying it, and it doesn&#39;t change anything.

A hard, round object presses against you. Despite knowing what it will do to you, you realize how much you want it inside. The end begins to stretch you open and despite your relaxed body it struggles to get in. 

As the pressure slowly increases you sense your hole growing wider. In your half-awake state you dream of wolves under the full moon and nights of lust and passion.

When the round object is halfway through, there is a brief moment of equilibrium, a stillness as you lie stretched and waiting. Then the tipping point comes and it sinks a millimeter further, after which your body takes over and greedily sucks it all the way in.

There is a sudden and intense wave of pleasure, along with sensation of fullness in your gut.

You take a stroll along the dusty shelves, trying to follow the source of the voice. Sometimes it&#39;s undeniably getting stronger, but just when you think you have it, it starts fading again.

After a long game of cat and mouse, you eventually reach a strange place at the back of the library, where the tomes look especially old. One of them in particular draws your attention - you&#39;re either going crazy or it&#39;s the source of the voice.

As soon as your fingers touch the ancient covers you feel a strange electric sensation run through you. This is not an ordinary book.

You turn the front page - it&#39;s covered with odd symbols and diagrams that are moving and shifting in front of your very eyes. Just looking at them gives you a headache.

You turn the pages and are immediately engrossed into a world of ancient stories of secrets and madness. The words seem to come alive on the page and before you know it an hour has passed and your mind is filled with tales of horrors you have never heard before.

With a trembling hand, you close the tome.

$A[They&#39;re right to say that knowledge has a price...]

For all that you&#39;ve learned, you feel that your grip on reality is a little looser. The shadows in the corner of your eye seem to be watching you, waiting for a moment of carelessness to strike at your back.

You feel like you&#39;ve lost a portion of your $clarity[sanity], but you&#39;ve learned a few $M[secrets].

As soon as you pull them out, her eyes widen and she pounces on them, snatching them from your hand and running off somewhere inside the Antique Boutique.

$a[&#39;Hello...?&#39;]

There is an eerie sensation of time stretching and condensing, like a bubble gum being chewed by a lazy panther. You have no idea where that mental image came from, but for some reason it sticks in your head. The minutes stretch, thick like honey, and the hours flow, quick like a mountain stream.

After 5 minutes, according to the mechanical clock on the wall, the antique boutique regurgitates its owner back to the reception.

It seems the servant has finally taken the hint and you feel him get his  cock out of his pants and start rubbing between your thighs. His breath is right behind your ear. 

You put the plate down and spread your legs apart obligingly, helping him get to the sweet spot. 

His member is rough and misshapen like the rest of his body. As it slides inside of you you can feel the bumps and irregularities. It slowly stretches you more and more, until it&#39;s all the way in. 

Thick and twisted.

There is something excitingly wrong as you feel the odd shape inside of you, the rough bumps triggering points of pleasure you didn&#39;t even know existed.

The early morning rays seep through the stained window glass, warming your face. You wake up with a sudden movement, rising in your bed. 

$a[&#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39;] you say out loud. There&#39;s no one to answer.

There is a brief period of confusion, than the memories flood your mind. Lavius, Felicia, Elise, Mihai, Ionut. Death by fangs and acts of desire. It all seems so distant, so surreal. 

$A[Was it all a dream? I feel weird...]

You look down at yourself, feeling your body.

$A[That&#39;s odd, I&#39;m still a woman... Did I manage to break the cycle? Or did time reset again?]

You hastily grab your phone from the night stand.

$A[It&#39;s TUESDAY! I made it, I survived!]

It seems that you&#39;ve managed to pull it off after all. You expected to be turned back by now, but perhaps Felicia can help you with that. Now that you&#39;ve escaped the loop, it should be just a formality.

You leap from a bed and start getting dressed, when a glimpse in the mirror [[catches your eye]].

$A[&#39;What the bloody HELL?!&#39;]

In the mirror, a beautiful young creature stares at you. She has a pair of small white horns sticking out of her head.

Your hands dart up and sure enough they&#39;re there - a tiny pair, barely a few inches out of the skin. They feel hard and rough, almost like stone. You stand awestruck, refusing to acknowledge reality.

$a[What is happening to me?]

With your heart racing, you sit back on the bed, trying to catch your breath. You&#39;ve seen a lot of weird things around here already, but this strikes too close for comfort. It isn&#39;t the first time your body has changed, but so far you&#39;ve always been.... human, you suppose. 

And now you&#39;ve become [[something else]].

You are no longer human. The thought just pops in your head, both frightening and arousing you. You can&#39;t tell why, but you are absolutely certain of it. 

If you have horns now, perhaps there are other changes to your body as well. You&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re brave enough to know. But then again, you have to.

$Io[&#39;Not var now,&#39;] he replies, panting with effort.

The servant heads down the familiar path along the side of the manor and towards the basement.

The sound of Mihai&#39;s footsteps is suddenly gone and you realize that he must have reached the top of the tower. Which means that you will too.

You slow down your progress to a crawl, placing each foot down as carefully and as silently as you can. Eventually, you reach the door leading to the top of the tower. There is a draft blowing in your face. You reach forward, but your fingers grasp only darkness...


$A[Mihai must have left the door open... this will make it easier to hear what they&#39;re talking about.]

This is clearly way too dangerous to be worth a few overheard sentences. Last time you climbed into the tower, it cost you your life. 

$A[Perhaps I can try again, when Mihai isn&#39;t there?]

You&#39;re not certain what good can this do either, but at least you won&#39;t run into **two** vampires at once.

You consider this. With everything that you&#39;ve already seen around her, perhaps you shouldn&#39;t be expecting to find Ariel. You remember the mermaids of the old myths, luring sailors to the rocks and feeding on their bodies with long sharp teeth....

$a[&#39;Alright, Ionut, I&#39;ll trust you on this one. And don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t tell Mihai anything.&#39;]

You pause for a moment and scratch your head. Did you miss it? The narrow front of the shop was barely noticeable, squeezed between two stone houses. You make a 180 and head down the main street again, looking even more closely at the narrow spaces between buildings.

The Antique Boutique is not there.

$A[What the hell is going on...?]

You stroll down the street for a third time, but to no avail. The feeling that something is off keeps getting stronger. Perhaps someone at the inn could help shed some light on the situation?

After a brief descent you reach the wooden door at the bottom of the staircase. It&#39;s quite heavy, but you manage to open it with some pushing.

The inside opens into a long hallway bathing in dirty yellow light from the electric bulbs. The walls are covered in copper pipes and valves with several large doors on either side. The air is heavy and humid, leaving a metal taste in your mouth.

You already know one of the rooms, where you found the fuel for the generator. Perhaps you should explore the rest?

You collapse on the floor, the life sapped from you.

$A[What was that all about...? Seemed somehow important, yet I can&#39;t recall any thing specific...]

For the moment you decide to brush it aside and focus on the present. Then, you remember.

$a[&#39;Those bastards!&#39;] you swear under your breath. You knew that Lavius was not to be trusted, but never expected something like this.

As for the rest.... you try to think back about what you last saw. 

$A[Elise was with them, but she didn&#39;t seem to like it. Perhaps the right words will persuade her to switch camp. Then there&#39;s the werewolf...]

As far as you can remember, the man didn&#39;t seem very fond of Lavius. Down there he was in his bestial form, so perhaps he wasn&#39;t fully aware what he was doing... you will need to learn more.

$A[Who does this leave?] 

You pace around the room. Mihai and Ionut were dead, but you have a feeling that you&#39;re missing something. 

$A[I don&#39;t think Felicia was involved...]

Then you remember. $A[The box!] It was gone when you went to the basement. But it didn&#39;t seem to be in the room either. Where did it go, and how is it connected to all this? You have no clue. $A[And then there&#39;s also the Elder...]

You take a deep breath. It&#39;s going to be a long day.

The beast pushes on top of you with its full weight, forcing your head down in the mud as your ass raises to accommodate it&#39;s giant member. 

However much you try to take control, your body craves it. It needs it. Your $breasts are bouncing freely with every thrust of the beast, moans escaping your $lips despite your best efforts.

$A[How can this feel so good?]

Your tail, which isn&#39;t your tail, curls up obediently as the beast finally tenses up, its member inflating inside you. 

There is something primal, bestial deep inside of you, that is now $a[**awakening**]. The creature bites down on your neck, locking you into place and you feel a series of spurts shoot deep inside your womb. The bracelet glows hot on your wrist, a new bead blossoming crimson as your body absorbs the life energy.

The desire grows inside of you, rising like a tidal wave that threatens to wash over your entire mind. You want to succumb to it so badly, though the last remaining voice of reason warns you that it may have dire consequences. You&#39;re not sure if you really care at this point.

A powerful thrust from the beast finally breaks you. A long, animalistic howl escapes your throat, echoing among the darkness of the pine trees.

The werewolf keeps you in place as more spurts spill from its inflated knot. Your mind succumbs to the overflowing pleasure as a pink haze drowns all remaining thoughts.

Through the darkness of the forest, other howls answer yours in the distance. Your body shivers from fear and excitement. Something is about to happen.

Even as the werewolf is still finishing up with you, you see a number of yellow eyes observing you among the trees and bushes. 

Unphased, the beast does one final thrust, before leaving your body to collapse on the mossy earth.

You lie on the ground on all fours, head bowed down and ass up in the air as the pack of wolves [[emerges from the darkness]].

Trying your best to keep a fragment of control, you resist the unspeakable urges inside of you and remain quiet, letting the creature do its thing.

The werewolf keeps you in place for a few more minutes, until his knot finally deflates and he plops free from you. A drip of semen spills to the ground, overflowing from your used pussy.

With a dizzy head, you slowly recover from the experience. The smell of wet earth is mixed with the musky aroma of bestial sweat and sex. A wave of guilt and shame overcomes you.

When you finally manage to get up, your legs shaking, the beast is nowhere to be seen. Without you realizing, the devil gown has returned to its normal shape, a long elegant dress covering your figure in the splendor expected from a dancing hall. 

Your shaking walk is the only indication that anything happened at all. 

After a bit of wandering, you manage to return to the familiar path up the stream.

$Mi[&#39;I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re safe and sound, my dear Alexandra. It&#39;s true that our village can sometimes be a dangerous place.&#39;]

Ionut brings you the frigărui, which you dig into while Mihai keeps sipping from his glass. 

$Mi[&#39;My father used to say that the only way to hold everything together is through fear and discipline. Unbreakable rules that must be followed.&#39;]

Just when you&#39;re about to enter your room, you hear a strange little voice behind you.

$M[&#39;Psst, o&#39;er here!&#39;]

In the darkness, two green eyes are peering at you. The black cat approaches into the light.

$a[&#39;Uhm, Hello?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Evening, darling. You&#39;ve made it this far. Good job. Just don&#39;t let it go to your head.&#39;] The voice echoes in your head, with a smooth jazzy tone that is a little surprising coming from a small feline.

$a[&#39;Do I know you?&#39;] You look at the tiny creature. It looks just like an ordinary alley cat.

$M[&#39;You know my mistress, if you didn&#39;t already guess that.&#39;] He - for the voice is now undeniably male - manages to look down on you patronisingly despite the height difference.

$a[&#39;Right. So, uhmm... what do you want?&#39;]

$A[Damn this devil gown! It got me into this mess on purpose..!!]

The realization does too little too late. The Alpha jumps on you first, while the others watch and wait respectfully around him. 
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/wolf_pack.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

An actual wolf feels much smaller and weaker than the creature before him, but you moan all the same. In fact, you can&#39;t help it. It is as if you&#39;ve completely lost control over your actions.

The bracelet glows incredibly hot, and so do the different parts that of the transformed devil&#39;s gown. You suddenly feel something appear on your back, right under the wolf&#39;s belly.

$A[What- what&#39;s going on? Dammit, I can&#39;t focus, can&#39;t think!]

Your mind is a complete and total haze and you don&#39;t fully understand what&#39;s going on. Once the Alpha is done with you, he steps aside, leaving the rest of the pack to have their turn. 

After a while you lose track of beasts that have had their way with you, everything mixing into a blur of sweat, sex and howling.

The creature is looming over you. It&#39;s close enough that the smell hits you, a bestial smell of sweat and mucus that is both repulsive and attractive in its repulsiveness. Your body responds to it with a growing hotness an a light-headed feeling that borders on euphoria.

The creature takes bends over you and your eyes fall down to its giant erection. 

$A[Damn it, I used too much pheromones!]

Your error is clear now, but it&#39;s too late to fix it. The intentions of the beast are clear and you doubt you can outrun or dissuade it. On one hand, attempting to flee some more can at least save you some face and if you don&#39;t manage to escape, you&#39;ll know that at least you&#39;ve tried. On the other hand, if you cooperate perhaps things will go down a lot smoother for you...

You already know what&#39;s going to happen, and it&#39;s driving you crazy.

The fabric becomes liquid gold, flowing down your skin under the silvery moonlight. Just like before, it leaves most of your body naked, condensing into a fluffy tail and a pair of wolf ears perking out of your hair.

The heat inside of you flares again, your unprotected crotch pointing at the beast. How did you find yourself in this position again?

The beast enters you with a growl, stretching you wide with a single thrusts. He&#39;s too big, way too big for you, but your flesh stretches and adapts with unnatural ease, letting the werewolf&#39;s giant phallus plunge deep inside you.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/scene1.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

$A[Alex, why are you doing this to yourself?]

The beast pushes on top of you with its full weight, forcing your head down in the mud as your ass raises to accommodate it&#39;s giant member. 

You no longer try to take control, your body craves it. It needs it. Your $breasts are bouncing freely with every thrust of the beast, moans escaping your $lips despite your best efforts.

$A[How can this feel so good?]

Your tail, which isn&#39;t your tail, curls up obediently as the beast finally tenses up, its member inflating inside you. 

There is something primal, bestial deep inside of you, that is $a[**awakening**] again. The creature bites down on your neck, locking you into place and you feel a series of spurts shoot deep inside your womb. The bracelet glows hot on your wrist, a new bead blossoming crimson as your body absorbs the life energy.

The desire grows inside of you, rising like a tidal wave that threatens to wash over your entire mind. 

You want to succumb to it so badly.

You want to give up. 

You want to give in.

If you didn&#39;t want that, you wouldn&#39;t be here again. Resistance is futile.

A long, animalistic howl escapes your throat, echoing among the darkness of the pine trees.

The werewolf keeps you in place as more spurts spill from its inflated knot. Your mind succumbs to the overflowing pleasure as a pink haze drowns all reason.

Through the darkness of the forest, other howls answer yours in the distance. Your body shivers from excitement. 

Even as the werewolf is still finishing up with you, you see a number of yellow eyes observing you among the trees and bushes. 

$A[They are waiting for me.]

Unphased, the beast does one final thrust, before leaving your body to collapse on the mossy earth.

You lie on the ground on all fours, head bowed down and ass up in the air, inviting the beasts to (link-reveal-goto:&quot;emerge from the darkness&quot;)[ (set: $sanity  to it -  20) (set: $howl to 1)].(set: _ti to 8)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="598" name="emerge from the darkness" tags="" position="6296,3828" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/div&gt;

This time your wings appear instantly, blossoming on your back like a red flag to let all the males know that you&#39;re in heat. You can feel your reason draining out and being replaced with deep, insatiable lust.

$A[More! I want more!]

Once the Alpha is done, the pack descends upon you. This time there is no order. As soon as one jumps you, another approaches your face. Helpless, you part your lips and let him hump your mouth, swallowing the salty semen.

The next one misses your pussy and plunges in your ass, though you don&#39;t seem to mind. Your body can accommodate anything. 

After a while you lose track of beasts that have had their way with you, everything mixing into a blur of sweat, sex and howling.

Currently Lavius, Elise and the werewolf (in fluffy slippers) are having a late breakfast with Mihai in the dining room. You somehow doubt that all of them have gotten together just for a friendly chat.

$rando[&#39;Looking to have some fun are you girl?&#39;] the bartender gives you a dirty look.

$a[&#39;No...&#39;] you blush. You&#39;re not even sure why you&#39;re really looking for them. (if: $lewd&gt;80)[And it&#39;s true that a your urges are getting really strong...]

$rando[&#39;Well they haven&#39;t come in today. As you said doll, they go with Lavius. They&#39;re probably wherever he is.&#39;]

$A[&#39;That&#39;s odd, I didn&#39;t see them at the hotel. And I doubt Mihai would invite them anyway.&#39;]

$rando[&#39;Just be warned doll. You&#39;re not really his type. What he likes, you ain&#39;t got, haha.&#39;] The bartender chuckles under his beard.

You make your way to the corner and approach the hooded figure.

$a[&#39;Mind if I sit?&#39;]

Zach looks up and you can see his eyes darting left and right around the room.

$z[&#39;Whatever it is, make it quick.&#39;]

You sit on the bench beside him, trying your best not to draw any more attention.

$a[&#39;Why the secrecy?&#39;]

$z[&#39;Because of your silly stunt, that&#39;s why darling!&#39;] he answers angrily. $z[&#39;Word on the street is Lavius has found out that someone broke into his lair and he&#39;s furious. I haven&#39;t seen him all day and his goons are missing too, so you can bet your pretty ass that they&#39;re up to something, and probably trying to find out who did it.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Zach, would you know where I can find Felicia? The owner of the antique boutique.&#39;]

$z[&#39;She&#39;s a tough one to find, doll. I imagine she didn&#39;t leave a note on her shop?&#39;]

You give a nervous laughter. $a[&#39;Not only is she gone, the whole shop is gone with her! It&#39;s like it never existed...&#39;]

Zachary sips from his tankard, deep in thought. $z[&#39;I believe you, doll. You are smarter than you look, and I&#39;ve heard enough rumors about this place.&#39;]

$a[&#39;But you don&#39;t know where to find her, do you?&#39;] you look at him with desperation. You realize just how much you&#39;ve come to rely on your feline acquaintance.

$z[&#39;Look for a place with books,&#39;] Zach whispers in a low voice. $z[&#39;I doubt her shop will pop-up in a cave or something. Chances are it will latch to another building. Perhaps that will help, but what do I know?&#39;]

He takes another sip, pulling his hood down. You decide to leave Zach alone before your little duo starts drawing unnecessary attention.

Strolling down the other hallway you emerge at the small game room. It has tall windows overlooking the garden, as well as a number of small tables surrounded by armchairs. Of course, the central feature is the old pool table, which is currently occupied by the two players.

$L[Lavius,] dressed in the finest velvet, is skipping around with a glass of wine in his hand. On the other end the $W[werewolf], currently in his human form and still wearing his bath robe and bunny slippers, is trying to aim a trick shot while puffing on a large cigar. 

The two of them seem to be in the middle of a heated discussion, but their voices hush as they see you approach.

$L[&#39;Well, well, well, if it isn&#39;t the beautiful damsel from the reception! Tell me, my dear, do you play pool?&#39;]

$L[&#39;Splendid! In that case, we can have a little competition! We do have some time to kill after all&#39;]

The werewolf rolls his eyes at Lavius, but doesn&#39;t seem to care all that much. Ignoring his annoyance completely, the vampire sets the balls into place.

$L[&#39;Loser owes a favor, agreed?&#39;] he grins. $L[&#39;You can start first of course.&#39;] 

It&#39;s pretty easy to see what Lavius wants, but despite your hindsight into his true nature you decide to play along. $A[I can probably beat him with some luck...]

Unfortunately for you, Lavius seems to be pretty good. He lets you score a few times, but quickly overtakes the table with precise shots that clear his balls while leaving yours in devilishly tricky positions.

As he walks past you for another shot, his hand rests comfortably on your waist. The $R[hunger] that has been growing in you since morning is now nearing a peak. Your belly is burning hot and you find it increasingly difficult to concentrate.

$A[Damn, it&#39;s like my own body isn&#39;t listening to me...]

Lavius&#39; hand slides from your waist down to your butt. Without thinking, you press against him, allowing him to get a good feel of it.

You take another shot, missing the ball completely. 

$L[&#39;It seems that it&#39;s not your best day, my dear!&#39;] exclaims Lavius with such a sweet voice that you barely catch his mockery. $L[&#39;And now it&#39;s time to pay your due. Perhaps you would like to take a brief walk with me in the library?&#39;]

$L[&#39;You have to hold it like this,&#39;] he explains, positioning your hand while leaning behind you. You can smell his perfume float towards you, the warmth of his breath at your neck as he showers you with sweet nothings.

You try to decline, but Lavius hushes you and takes you by the hand, leading you to the next room. You try to formulate something that would drive him away, but your mind is a blank.

You feel quite stupid and inadequate. Thinking straight is suddenly very difficult. Your body knows what&#39;s about to happen and it wants it.

Lavius pushes you against the wall, his lips trailing up your neck.

Sitting at the floor of the library you slowly compose yourself and get dressed again. Lavius has already gone, though you seem to have momentarily lost track of time.

A few things bubble to your conscious attention. First, the $R[hunger] that has been increasing all day has finally subsided. What is worrying however is that even if the urges have gone down, your mind still feels very hazy. In fact, it even feels $A[hazier] than before.

You feel as if you&#39;re a little drunk and concentration takes an effort. You know you should probably be more alarmed by this, but in your current state all you can do is quietly note the phenomenon.

Another thing that you notice is that your bracelet hasn&#39;t changed, despite the recent &quot;feeding&quot;. This is also something that should perhaps worry you.

Back on your feet again, you finally manage to regain some of your focus, though it&#39;s clear that something isn&#39;t quite right. 

The library is quiet.

Suddenly there is a tingling sensation at the back of your head. You turn towards the distant end of the room - the rows of shelves seem almost never ending.

$A[Did someone- did someone call my name?]

You hesitate.

Walking down the dusty aisles you begin to experience a strange sensation, one that you have felt before. There is something wrong with the space around you. The lines of the aisles somehow bend in weird ways, straight paths loop back into themselves.

The further you go, the stronger the feeling becomes. The air is thick and still like glass. The bits of dust hang frozen in the distance, illuminated by rays of still light.

You follow the gut feeling, turning left and right. You reach a point where you make 4 consecutive right turns, which should have looped you around a shelf... but instead you come across a [[familiar desk]].

You blink at the catwoman, trying to shake the mist from your head.

$a[&#39;It&#39;s hard - thinking...&#39;]

$M[&#39;I&#39;m sorry about the confusion - getting into this place requires some extra distortion. But let&#39;s face it - you aren&#39;t in the best of shapes either.&#39;]

$a[&#39;What do you mean?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Take your time, darling. You can do this.&#39;] Felicia pats you gently on the head.

You pause, composing yourself. Your thoughts feel like noodles floating in a giant bowl. Then finally they straighten up a little. Last night, the loop, the bracelet. The missing Antique Boutique. Which isn&#39;t missing anymore - because you&#39;re somehow standing right inside of it. Inside the library. 

You shake your head. It&#39;s probably better to take this one thing at a time.

$M[&#39;That&#39;s not what I said,&#39;] pouts Felicia. $M[&#39;You can&#39;t return to normal while in the loop. But breaking it doesn&#39;t automatically reverse things.&#39;]

You give a sigh. You thought you were close, but now it sounds like there&#39;s still more to do.

$A[&#39;Okay - can you turn me back now?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Nope.&#39;]

$A[&#39;Why not?&#39;]

$M[&#39;You&#39;re not a woman anymore, you&#39;re a succubus. Thought you might have noticed.&#39;]

Felicia gives you a funny look. $M[&#39;That&#39;s right. It seems that you&#39;ve used the powers of the bracelet one too many times. There&#39;s a limit a mortal body can be pushed to, and you lasted longer than most.&#39;]

$A[&#39;So... what now?&#39;] you ask, desperation creeping in your voice.

$M[&#39;There is still hope. Hope to return to normal... or hope to be happy with your current condition. You seem to be enjoying it quite a bit.&#39;]

You look away from the catwoman.

$A[&#39;It has had its moments...&#39;] you trail of, blushing.

Your mind shifts into the $a[haze] again, dreaming of all the things that happened. Thinking is hard again. With great effort, you focus on your present situation.

$A[&#39;It feels like my mind is refusing to function properly. Especially since the last thing that happened.&#39;]

$M[&#39;I understand,&#39;] Felicia nods. $M[&#39;succubae are not naturally intelligent creatures. They are led by lust and carnal desires. Now that your physical transformation is accelerating, so is the mental one.&#39;]

You swallow hard. $A[&#39;Does this mean...?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Yes. If you&#39;re not careful and give in to your desires, you can easily end up as a mindless sex demon.&#39;]

It should have been frightening to hear that, but instead you feel an arousal bubbling from the the depths of your belly. The image of a succubus in heat fills your mind. She is a slave to the pleasure, willing to do anything and everything...

$M[&#39;Hey, snap out of it!&#39;]

Felicia gives you a quick slap on the face, bringing you back. 

$M[&#39;I can&#39;t have you like this, you&#39;re no use. Hold on a moment.&#39;]

She turns away and disappears somewhere between the bookshelves.

$M[&#39;I&#39;ll have to dig through some books - your predicament is rather rare if I have to be honest. I expected you to either be cured or die before the transformation goes any further. You&#39;ve managed to accomplish quite the number of time loops...&#39;]

Felicia scratches her head, pensive. 

$A[&#39;I&#39;m sure you can think of something...?&#39;] You look at her hopefully.

$M[&#39;It should be possible, but I&#39;ll need to do some more research. In the meantime, try not to go overboard with the deaths, OK?&#39;]

You give a small nod, still trying to focus your attention. The warmth beneath your legs is growing, $a[screaming] for attention. You struggle to focus.

Time runs and stands still in the eerie frozen light of the library. You can&#39;t tell how many minutes pass before the mysterious catwoman emerges behind the counter again.

$M[&#39;Here, this should help clear your head a little.&#39;]

She&#39;s handing you a steaming cup of tea. You take it, bringing it up to sniff it carefully. It smells like a forest after rain, mixed with something fresh that you can&#39;t quite put your finger on.

As you down the cup, the mist in in your mind clears away, as if blown by a gentle breeze. Your thoughts calm down and it becomes easier to concentrate.

You slowly blink, as if waking up from a dream.

$clarity[You&#39;ve regained some sanity!]

You make your way back the winding passages of the library. Eventually the aisles become straight again and the light form the windows no longer stays frozen in the air. 

With a sigh of relief, you return to the game room.

Currently, there is no one there, but an empty glass of whiskey and a cigar butt. $A[Damn, look at the time! It&#39;s [$hour:$minute]&lt;time| already! Mihai mentioned that there would be a meeting of sorts in the evening...]

$Io[&#39;No! Mihai vaiting. You go, now!&#39;]

The servant grabs your wrist and pulls you back. You are yet again reminded of his incredible strength - he could easily move you around without breaking a sweat.

Resigned, you bow your head and walk back to The Crooked Elm.

$A[Where is everyone?]

If you hadn&#39;t been late, you would have known where to go.

You start to panic a little. You better find where they are and hope your late arrival is forgiven.

You take another tour of the ground floor, just to make sure. The kitchen and dining room, the game room and the library. Everything is silent.

Climbing on the first floor, you make the rounds. Not a sound. The hotel is eerily still. You knock on $Mi[Mihai&#39;s room], but no one answers.

You go to the second floor and try $E[Elise&#39;s room]. It&#39;s unlocked, but she isn&#39;t there. You try the other doors, with no luck.

Your only option is now the attic. You climb up and listen. The silence is even deeper.

$A[Perhaps in the tower?]

You head to the end of the hallway, then pause. You are forbidden to go in there. But the gate is unlocked. 

You take a deep breath and climb the stairs. At the top, the tower lays in utter darkness. There is no one there.

Confused, you go down again.

You&#39;ve checked every room in the hotel.

You step in the garden, looking up at The Crooked Elm. All the lights are out. The place looks like it&#39;s completely uninhabited.

You rub your eyes, holding your head in your hands. $A[Think, Alex, where can they be...]

Pacing back and forth in the garden, your gaze falls on the last place you haven&#39;t checked.

The basement.

You notice yet again that the inside of the &quot;basement&quot; actually resembles a dungeon, with a cold stony floor and pillars supporting the manor on top. 

There are several torches burning,  which illuminate the room just enough.

$A[Odd choice, given that the electricity is running...]

As before, you notice the pipes and valves covering most of the east wall and going into the ceiling, as well as a handful of crates, a workbench and some tools hanging near it; more torches and cobwebs wobbling by the cold draft; and of course, there is the generator.

The $in[box] that you left there earlier is nowhere to be seen. Looking around however, you spot an arm sticking behind a pile of boxes.

You go through the door and creep down the corridor. There are more torches burning to the side.

You go past a few junctions with smaller passageways branching to the sides, but they are darker and silent, so you press on the main path, speeding your step up.

At the end of the corridor you come upon a heavy wooden door. There is light seeping around the corners, and voices coming from inside.

You sigh with relief. $A[This must be where they&#39;ve gone... I should warn them about Ionut, perhaps someone can help.]

You push the door open and step inside.

$a[&#39;Sorry for being so late-&#39;]

The words freeze in your mouth, the eyes turn towards you. $L[Lavius], a silver dagger in hand, is looming over a body, which lays lifeless face down on the stone floor, dark blood forming a pool around it.

$L[&#39;Hello, darling, you&#39;re a little late to the party,&#39;] Lavius turns towards you with a sinister smile. $L[&#39;But don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll take good care of you.&#39;]

On the side of the scene, you see a big, bestial figure, standing half-upright with an arm in its jaws. There is a big splatter of blood on the wall behind, and you catch the edge of a golden cane, sticking out of the mess.

$A[Mihai...] you gasp.

In the far end of the room, you catch a number of silhouettes lurking in the shadows, rugged familiar faces grinning back at you.

Your heart racing in your throat, you turn around to flee. The doorway is blocked by a tall, dark figure.

$a[&#39;Elise! You have to help me, they have-&#39;]

You interrupt your sentence, seeing the cold light in her eyes.

$E[&#39;I&#39;m sorry sweetheart, it really isn&#39;t personal,&#39;] she says with some bitterness in her voice. $E[&#39;I wish things could be different, tsk. What a mess.&#39;]

The pain in your neck comes before you see the bite. The world starts spinning as the toxin spreads through your veins. You collapse on the floor (link-reveal-goto:&quot;sinking into the darkness.&quot;,&quot;DIESUCCUBUS&quot;)[

$A[This can&#39;t be dangerous, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t let me do it alone. But then again...]

You&#39;ve been left in plenty of perilous situations, so you don&#39;t feel all too reassured right now.

You circle the box cautiously. It looks pretty well sealed, but you finally manage to find a few clips and latches which hold the lid. After some work, it seems to be free.

You carefully lift the lid of the box. As you expected, it&#39;s filled with water. 

You stand on guard, expecting something to jump or slither out... but nothing happens. You allow yourself to take a better look, peering directly on top of the surface. It&#39;s only water... as far as you can see. It feels like staring into the infinite depths of the sea.

You take a piece of meat you drop it into the box. It starts sinking, further and further down, until it slowly disappears from view.

You drop the rest of the meat and close the lid. It&#39;s an unsettling experience that your mind has some trouble dealing with.

You try not think about the box.

He gives a sigh and his expression softens. $Mi[&#39;We finished around half an hour ago, so it&#39;s okay.

To your surprise, the two tall buildings that you distinctly remember on either side of the boutique are now right next to each other, with no space in between.

You pause for a moment and scratch your head. Did you miss it? The narrow front of the shop was barely noticeable, but still. You make a 180 and head down the main street again, looking even more closely at the narrow spaces between buildings.

The Antique Boutique is not there.

It&#39;s a beautiful day in the mountains, the clear path by the stream cheerful and sunny despite the twilight between the trees. As long as you don&#39;t wander into the actual forest, all will be well.

You make your way down, enjoying the silence of nature and the scent of pines. The moment is so peaceful you&#39;re almost ready to forget your troubles.

Making your way down the steep forest trail, you finally emerge at the village. The familiar group of stone houses nested together at the mountain slope initially look unchanged, but you quickly pick up that things are not the same as before.

Just like last time, the usually lethargic village is now somehow restless. There are people moving hurriedly through the village center and an almost tangible sense of tension in the otherwise calm mountain air. Something is definitely going on.

The inside opens into a long hallway bathing in dirty yellow light from the electric bulbs. The walls are covered in copper pipes and valves with several large doors on either side. The air is heavy and humid, leaving a metal taste in your mouth.

The figure looming above you steps back into the light, and you recognize tha man from the inn. Before you can say anything he leans in and forces a nail through your other wing, securing it in place.

The man grabs your top and tears it open, exposing your breasts. With a swift movement, two metal clamps click around your nipples, sending a jolt of pain through your body.

Another shock hits you, sending waves of pain and pleasure through your spine. The $A[hunger] that was at bay for a while is now growing strong again. Your thoughts are becoming cloudy.

The next shock sends you into the beginning of an euphoria. You feel lightheaded and numb.

You meekly shake your head, struggling for words. Your only hope is to wait for death and reset. If they learn your secrets, they could keep you a prisoner forever.

To your horror and shame, you comply with his request. The metal slides easily in your already wet pussy. Soon after, the next shock comes, this time stimulating you from all sides.

Another shock comes, and you can sense that they&#39;re increasing the voltage. Your mind starts going blank. You are unable to think straight.

With the next zap, you start climbing towards an orgasm.

The man grabs you by the hair and shoves his cock in your mouth. You begin sucking obediently, unable to help yourself.

At the same time, something strange happens. You can&#39;t explain how you know it, but you can see. Vivid as day in your mind&#39;s eye, the bracelet loses one of its (colour:&quot;#FFCCCC&quot;)[crimson beads].

However the horrifying reality of the situation is still not enough to sober you up, and the next shock sends you moaning back into pleasure.

You could go down, now. With some luck, Mihai won&#39;t hear you and you&#39;ll be on your way without anyone suspecting that you were ever here.

Alternatively... Your mind races. The corridor is pitch black. You could probably slip inside the room quickly enough, without Mihai noticing anything.

Your memory is a growing mess. You blink at the man, confused.

You try to calm down and observe your surroundings. You are in a room filled with various contraptions, no doubt still somewhere in Lavius&#39; laboratory. There is a single yellow bulb illuminating the man in front of you. Squinting beyond the electric halo, you notice his friends, leaning behind in the shadows...

As quickly and quietly as you can, you make your way down the spiraling staircase, careful not to trip in the darkness.

Eventually, you see the light of the exit and emerge back into the familiar hallway of the attic.


$A[Phew! That was a little too close for comfort. I better hurry and head downstairs before Mihai makes it down as well.]

You breathe deeply to calm your racing heart and pretend that nothing has happened. $in[Your gut tells you that you have gained a piece of valuable information, even if you&#39;re not yet sure how to use it.]

Now, it&#39;s time to press on.

He turns around just as you slide behind the door, hoping that he didn&#39;t see you.

His footsteps approach closer and closer. You can hear the gentle tapping of his cane on the floor of the room.

Finally, Mihai passes by, swinging the door shut behind him. Now you can finally take a look at the room in front of you. The tower&#39;s top is a large circular space, dominated by a massive throne of bones and skulls. The dead sockets seem to be staring at you somehow, making you feel uneasy.

To your sides, you can see other piles of skulls, arranged in ominous shapes.

Before you have the time to observe too carefully, a voice hisses from above: $R[&#39;Whhy are you hhere...?&#39;] (change: ?page,(bg:&quot;https://xfiction.org/images/tr/environments/throne.jpg&quot;))](else:)[Your heart racing, you decide to go for it.

$A[Calm down, Alexandra.... even if Mihai can see in the dark... you are behind the door, he won&#39;t notice you...]

The owner&#39;s footsteps approach closer and closer. You can hear the gentle tapping of his cane on the wooden floor of the room.

The door swings shut as Mihai passes by. Only after you hear him descend calmly down the stairs do you finally allow yourself to breathe.

You exhale a deep sigh of relief.

$L[&#39;You don&#39;t need to help me, darling, I am quite capable of winning on my own!&#39;] he grins at you.

On your next shot you try it again, but just can&#39;t seem your trajectories right. You try to position the 8 ball to get in his way, but you end up pocketing it instead!

Lavius&#39; look of exasperation quickly gives way to a gracious defeat.

$L[&#39;I admit, I have lost... you are quite the formidable opponent.&#39;]

He bows deeply and takes your hand to kiss it.

$L[&#39;As agreed, we will honor your request. Which one of us do you want to accompany you for a walk in the garden?&#39;]

You eye Lavius, who seems eager enough to go with you, and then move your eyes to the man in the bathrobe and bunny slippers, who is silently puffing on his cigar. 

$A[Either one of them could yield a clue to what&#39;s going...]

You consider your options. $L[Lavius] is sure to talk more, but he clearly wants to get in your pants. $W[Wolfie boy] is the silent type, but you might get some straight facts out of him.

Just as you&#39;re turning around, Lavius&#39; hand on your shoulder stops you gently but firmly.

$L[&#39;I do remember that you owe us a wager, sweetheart.&#39;]

You swallow hard. It&#39;s not hard to guess what lavius has in mind. $A[At least an extra charge will come in handy...]

He grabs the top of your dress and rips it apart, yanking your whole body forward. Pieces of the gown fall down as your breasts are exposed to hang naked in the air.

With his friends holding you down, your interrogator nails your wings to the wall. The pain is sharp, but the worst part is the helplessness.

He grabs the top of your dress and rips it apart, yanking your whole body forward. Your nailed wings scream in pain. Pieces of the gown fall down as your breasts are exposed to hang naked in the air. 

$rando[&#39;You&#39;re a succubus, right? These must be extremely sensitive...&#39;]

He pinches and twists one of your nipples, stealing a moan from your lips. You don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s the influence of his device or the strange relationship with pain that you&#39;ve developed, but these horrifying things are also horribly turning you on.

He approaches you with two wires, ending with pincers. You know where this is going, and you don&#39;t like it.

He tears away the rest of your dress, leaving your upper torso completely naked. Then he attaches a pincer to each of your nipples.

$rando[&#39;Look at me, girl,&#39;] he says in a low voice, lifting your chin up. $rando[&#39;Believe me, this gives me great pleasure. But I will make it easy on you if you cooperate. And if you don&#39;t...]

His hand reaches under between your thighs, caressing your slit. $rando[&#39;We&#39;ll make this looong and painful.&#39;]

You give a quiet whimper as his finger enters your wet hole.

The pleasure continues to grow, kindled by the quickening pace of his fingers down your crotch. Despite your best efforts, the heat in your belly is growing.

$rando[&#39;You&#39;re a good little bitch, aren&#39;t you? Don&#39;t worry, we can make you scream in more ways than one...&#39;]

The tingling increases, feeling like tiny needles sticking under your skin. There is some pain, but in your current state it only heightens your arousal.

$a[&#39;Aaah!&#39;] you cry out, failing to conceal your pleasure.

The man&#39;s fingers plunge all the way inside your wet hole, stretching you open.

$rando[&#39;Good little bitch! We&#39;ll break you, then we&#39;ll make you talk, then we&#39;ll break you again, just for the sport!&#39;]

He reaches to the device, turning a knob up. The tingling rises sharply, the needles growing into knives.

His subordinates erupt into laughter, visibly excited. Some of them seem eager to have fun with you as well.

As your body finally stops shaking, you feel a sudden **cold** around your wrist.

Even without looking, you can tell that **your bracelet has lost one of it&#39;s $cri[crimson beads]!**

You aren&#39;t sure what just happened, but in an instant your pleasure turns into panic. You only have $bcharges left! If this continues, you will have none remaining, and then your life will truly be in the hands of these bastards.

One look at their leader tells you that they aren&#39;t letting you walk out of here alive.

He doesn&#39;t let you sit and think on this though. Before you&#39;ve even recovered from your orgasm, he turns the device on again.

Not needing a second invitation, Lavius jumps to the opportunity. He wraps his arms around you, adjusting your grip on the cue.

As his body is pressing against yours, you can feel his erection poking against your butt. Your body grows hot as well, the $a[hunger] in you demanding to be satiated.

A hard cock is inside of you and currently that&#39;s all you can think about. The room is spinning and your holes are burning with desire. You try to focus on the cue and the ball, but your hand is slipping.

You lean on the table not without a hint of eagerness, letting your panties slide to the floor. Having something inside of you that you will have **no** control over sounds both frightening and incredibly exciting.

Lavius smacks your ass and presses the plug between your cheeks.

$L[&#39;Are you ready, dear?&#39;]

Not waiting for your reply, he presses down and you feel it gently stretch your hole, sliding deeper and deeper inside. Soon the widest part is right at the threshold, and with just another small push and a little whimper from your lips it softly slides all the way in, lodging in place.

$L[&#39;There, all done. You quite enjoyed that, it seems!&#39;] he says gleefully, tracing a finger along your wet entrance.

$a[&#39;H-How long do I have to keep it in?&#39;]

$L[&#39;As long as I decide, sweetheart! You lost, now you have to bear the consequences.&#39;]

Your butt feels surprisingly full for such a small thing. There is an odd feeling emanating from it, it&#39;s almost... *spicy*.

You wonder if the plug really can&#39;t be taken out, or Lavius is just taking you for a ride. $A[Even if it really is enchanted, I **am** a succubus after all, perhaps it won&#39;t effect me?]

$A[How hard can this be...?]

You clench your butt, attempting to push the object out. It&#39;s an odd sensation. For such a small thing it&#39;s surprisingly hard to bulge.

As you put more strength in, it&#39;s almost as if the harder you push, the bigger it becomes, lodging itself just after your little butthole. Your efforts become excruciating as the object starts swelling and pushing against your inner walls.

Despite your best efforts, you&#39;ve made almost no progress at all into pushing it out.

Resigned, you relax your muscles and it slides back in again, lodging itself deeper with a vengeance.

$a[&#39;Eek!&#39;]

Laughter erupts from your two companions as they observe your reaction.

$L[&#39;The more you push, the deeper it goes, love. You will have to learn to relax and accept it, unless you want to be butt-fucked as you walk around. Then again, the choice is yours.&#39;]

You quickly realise that you won&#39;t last very long with this thing.

A hard cock is inside of you and currently that&#39;s all you can think about. The room is spinning and your holes are burning with desire.

$L[&#39;And you choose to sit and watch surprisingly often for a man of your vigor, my friend.&#39;]

The pace is quickening and your hips are bouncing back, grinding against the man behind you. You want it and you want it now.

With a final, deep stroke, Lavius finished inside of you. There is an explosion of pleasure and another bead blossoms on your wrist.

You have so many questions and so few answers. You munch your food in the candle-lit penumbra of the dining hall, when the strange woman comes in and sits at Mihai&#39;s table. You lend an ear to their conversation, though you aren&#39;t able to hear much, and your mind is distracted with other matters:

You turn your head to the left and gasp, taking a few steps back. $Felicia is giving you an unreadable smile, her feline, green and golden eyes shooting through you like an arrow. She is, undeniably, not human. Her ears, her real ears, are on top of her head, like some perverted japanese fantasy, complemented by a long and fluffy tail that she wiggles behind her. 

She is, however, not the definition of cute one would expect from an anthropomorphic feline. Your eyes are drawn to her facial features - cold, enigmatic and vicious, with a carnivorous smile filled with sharp fangs. Her fingers end with long, curved claws that she moves with an agile elegance which leaves no doubt she could rend you to pieces in seconds, if she wanted to. 

$M[&#39;What, did you swallow your tongue, girl?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I-  uh-  you&#39;re really a cat..&#39;]

$M[&#39;And you&#39;re really slow, even for a human.&#39;] She leaps to the other side of the counter again, landing perfectly without getting tangled in any of the merchandise despite the tight space.

$M[&#39;Go on then. Enjoy the truth.&#39;]

Something in the way she looks at you gives you a cold chill.

$E[&#39;What a good girl Mihai has chosen. I will train you to serve me well, my dear.&#39;]

You moan softly, growing wetter at her touch. The black woman has an intoxicating presence, pushing all of the right buttons and drawing you into a web of submission...

$E[&#39;My dear, how many children do you want to have? I hear humans typically have only one or two, but you could have an entire legion...&#39;]

You stroll down the hallway, eyeing the portraits one by one and reading the names on the plaques.

$a[So many of these guys are named Vasil... must be one of those hereditary names.]

One of the portraits is probably of the current Vasil Petrescu, Mihai&#39;s father. Not having met him, it&#39;s impossible to know which one. Perhaps Something you can look into later.

Feeling a little overwhelmed, you head away from the village center, past the few rows of stone houses and into the nearby trees.

The forest is not very dense here and you can still see the village rooftops through the branches. Unlike the deeper parts of the forest, the sparse trees here let through enough sunshine for grass to grow. The weather is just perfect and you take a moment to stroll through the greenery, before sitting on a soft mossy patch under a pine tree.

$A[So... I really am a woman now, huh?]

You run your hands from your chest to your hips, feeling the new curves.  Part of you still can&#39;t believe it.

You don&#39;t want to undress here, but your curiosity is getting the better of you. You let your hands wander a little, exploring the changes.

$A[Most of my body feels kinda the same.... and yet different.]

The $suit that you got from Felicia is a nice reminder of your past self, but now that you really think about it, you start to wonder how it would feel to wear actual feminine clothing, perhaps something simple and light...

You touch your face like a child, discovering a new toy for the first time. Your lips definitely feel fuller and softer. Your features haven&#39;t changed drastically, but at the same time you are a new person, quite literally...

Several minutes fly by as you feel around your body, trying to compare how things have changed.

You try to organize things in your head. It&#39;s quite bewildering when you think about it. The observable state of reality contradicts everything that you thought you knew about the world.

$A[There is still so much that people don&#39;t know, isn&#39;t there?]

After meeting these strange characters, going through changes yourself and even seeing time rewind, you are starting to question the concepts of science and rationality that have guided you through life so far. 

Perhaps the only way to truly understand the events around you is to embrace the occult and try to play by their rules? But then again, some part of you still believes that there has to be a rational explanation for everything. Even if magic is real, it should obey a similar set of rules as science...

The more you think about it, the more obvious it seems. All those stories you read as a kid, the superstitions, your grandma&#39;s tales. The signs has always been there.

The world is a dark, twisted place, and man is floating on a lifevest of logic on top of an ocean of insanity. When forces beyond your control pulled you below, it&#39;s finally time to sink or swim.

You feel that you have overcome a part of your internal turmoil and your thinking has become a little clearer.

You refuse to let the unknown get the better of you. No matter how strange and inexplicable these phenomena might seem, you will find a way to understand them.

The world is a dark, twisted place, and it&#39;s a man&#39;s job to carry the light of wisdom and knowledge, turning the shadows of the night into things of flesh and blood.

You feel that your thoughts are getting a little clearer.

The images plaque your conscious mind like buzzing insects that refuse to go away. Your heart beating frantically, struggling for life in those final moments.... 

You remember the void that followed, a place beyond reason and comprehension, a hollow space turned inside-out.

You can&#39;t help but feel an unrational attraction and a deep curiosity. You feel like standing on a tall ledge, l&#39;appel du vide calling you to plunge forward. Part of you wants to go back and experience it over again.

Your limp body being dragged down the dark hallway... razor sharp legs spinning silky dreams... the tightness, the constriction, and the horror that followed...

You feel a droplet of cold sweat run down your spine. The experience is still fresh in your mind.

$a[&#39;Mr. Petrescu, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you something...&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$Mi[&#39;Yes, Miss Alexandra?&#39;]

You take a moment to consider your next words. This place is strange, and its inhabitants are even stranger. But perhaps it would not be wise to be so blunt with your host.

$a[&#39;I was just wondering about your hotel. The architecture doesn&#39;t seem modern, it must have been built by your ancestors. I am very interested in history, so was wondering if you can tell me a bit about that.&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;I see.&#39;] Mihai observes you for a moment, tapping his fingers on the top of his golden cane. $Mi[&#39;I admire your interest. Indeed, The Crooked Elm has stood here for more than 400 years. It was first built by my fa-, I mean great-great-great-grandfather Vasil Petrescu, when our family first moved to these lands. The local folk were initially hostile to him, which is why he made his manor a place of hospitality, in order to welcome all under his wing.&#39;]

$a[&#39;He must have been a great man.&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;Indeed he is. Did this satisfy your curiosity?&#39;]

Mihai raises an eyebrow. $Mi[&#39;Anything unusual? Whatever do you mean?&#39;]

His calm stare pierces through you, making you shift uncomfortably in your chair.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$a[&#39;I heard the villagers mention some rumors...&#39;]

Mihai raises an eyebrow inquisitively, but doesn&#39;t respond. It&#39;s clear that getting information out of him regarding the supernatural will not be easy. $A[Perhaps he doesn&#39;t trust me yet?]

You cough lightly, clearing your throat.

$a[&#39;I was just wondering if you&#39;ve noticed anything out of the ordinary.&#39;]

You feel like it&#39;s been an eternity since the last time Mihai blinked.

$Mi[I think you are looking at things from the wrong angle, young miss. There is no such thing as *ordinary*. Everything is a matter of perspective. What is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly.&#39;] He makes a meaningful pause. $Mi[&#39;My advice to you is - don&#39;t be the fly. By the time you realise you&#39;ve been caught in a web, it will be too late.&#39;]

Your eyes lock and for a moment you feel the urge to tell him, but ultimately decide against it. $A[It may be too late for the fly, but not for me, old man...]

Mihai nods, then pushes the coins towards you.

$A[Let&#39;s see what Mihai has in his collection...]

You&#39;re not quite certain where to begin, so you choose a quiet corner at random and start going through the titles of the books around you.

$A[(display:&quot;book titles&quot;)]

You take out the volume and brush off the dusty cover. The leather chair is perfect for reading, so you lean back and start turning the pages.

Time flies surprisingly fast, and before you know it, your head is filled with arcane formulas, obscure ingredients and bizarre claims. If true, this would have extraordinary implications.

You close the book and take a deep breath. It&#39;s not easy to take it all in. The more you think about it, the more you are convinced that...

It&#39;s hard to wrap your brain around it, but somehow it rings true. The proof of magic is right before your eyes. The scribbles of old mystics slowly unveil the hidden secrets of the world.

You know that man still has much to discover about the world and the universe, but this just can&#39;t be it. It doesn&#39;t make any sense.

You decide that you shan&#39;t let the scribbles of old men dictate your life. You will uncover the truth for yourself.

You take the stairs up, climbing an increasingly narrow passage that culminates with at a small square platform with no doors.

It&#39;s pretty dark and at first it seems like a dead end, but then you notice there&#39;s a ladder propped on your right. Your eyes trace it up to the ceiling, where you make out a rectangular shape.

$A[Is that a trap door...?]

You grab the ladder and climb up, pushing the trap door open with one hand.

A puff of dust raises as you peak your head into the space above.

Unlike the floor above, here the metallic valves and copper wires are few and far between, instead giving way to ornate chandeliers and a thick carpet.

$A[I can definitely see why he calls it a &quot;lair&quot;...]

You walk in a thick silence, your footsteps completely absorbed by the red carpet. You see a door on the right, which you recognise. It&#39;s purple with a golden handle. It&#39;s Lavius&#39; room. 

Farther down the hall there is also another door, which is black with a silver handle. After it you can see another flight of stairs leading further down.

You lie face down on the sliky whiteness, arms together clutching the pillow and legs slightly spread apart. Your body grows hotter and you sense a deep need in your belly, an itch that you can&#39;t quite scratch.

The moisture between your legs grows.

Slowly you slide a hand down under your garments and inside your pants. It&#39;s warm and wet. It feels good.

You imagine the creature appearing from behind you, its sting plunging between your folds. Laying its eggs inside you. Inflating your belly.

Your fingers accelerate, rubbing your little bud and occasionally reaching inside you.

You have been blessed, you were able to experience being taken by the creature, and yet live to remember it.

You rub yourself faster still.

In fact, nothing is stopping you from doing it again. You could just make yourself a present. Lie on the bed. Spread your legs. Present your snatch, wet and willing, to the creature when it comes. It will gladly comply. And if worst comes to worst, the bracelet would bring you back...

It would be so simple. All you have to do is stay...

You head away from the village center, past the few rows of stone houses and into the nearby trees.

The forest is not very dense here and you can still see the village rooftops through the branches. Unlike the deeper parts of the forest, the sparse trees here let through enough sunshine for grass to grow. The weather is just perfect and you take a moment to stroll through the greenery, before sitting on a soft mossy patch under a pine tree.

You try to organize things in your head. It&#39;s quite bewildering when you think about it. The observable state of reality contradicts everything that you thought you knew about the world.

$A[There is still so much that people don&#39;t know, isn&#39;t there?]

After meeting these strange characters, going through changes yourself and even seeing time rewind, you are starting to question the concepts of science and rationality that have guided you through life so far. 

Perhaps the only way to truly understand the events around you is to embrace the occult and try to play by their rules? But then again, some part of you still believes that there has to be a rational explanation for everything. Even if magic is real, it should obey a similar set of rules as science...

The more you think about it, the more obvious it seems. All those stories you read as a kid, the superstitions, your grandma&#39;s tales. The signs has always been there.

The world is a dark, twisted place, and man is floating on a lifevest of logic on top of an ocean of insanity. When forces beyond your control pulled you below, it&#39;s finally time to sink or swim.

You feel that you have overcome a part of your internal turmoil and your thinking has become a little clearer.

You refuse to let the unknown get the better of you. No matter how strange and inexplicable these phenomena might seem, you will find a way to understand them.

The world is a dark, twisted place, and it&#39;s a man&#39;s job to carry the light of wisdom and knowledge, turning the shadows of the night into things of flesh and blood.

You already have enough proof that logic is not always the best answer. Perhaps there is a deeper reason for the unsettling feeling in your gut.

You close your eyes and let your intuition guide you.

$a[I know you&#39;re there...] you mumble to the air.

Ever so subtly, something moves in the corner of your eye. The shadows in the corner are ever so slightly different. 

You take a deep breath and try to calm your racing heart.

$A[...]

(display:&quot;unav&quot;)

Your vision blurs for a moment, then comes into focus again. You turn your head and face an eerie floating figure.

$a[&#39;Hello?&#39;]

The figure is too distorted to make out anything more than a vague human outline. It lingers for a few moments, then slowly turns around and starts moving down the hallway.

You walk behind the figure which slowly hovers down the hallway, passing several rooms. It halts in front of an empty section of the wall.

Now that you think about it, by all logic of the layout of the hotel, there should be a door there. But all there is is an empty wall... and a shield hanging on top of it.

The shield is a large ornamental one, probably never made for real battle. You can see intricate scenes hammered into the surface, with warriors and creatures engaged in eternal fight.

The apparition raises a hand, pointing to a part of the ornamentation. Then it hovers forwards, disappearing through the wall. 

$A[It seems that it&#39;s trying to tell me something...]

You examine the $in[metal figures] carefully. When you move your fingers along the surface, part of the scene presses down, sinking into the shield.

The wall slides open, revealing a hidden entrance.

Who knows what horrors can this lead to? It might be trying to ask for help or leading you to your doom. It is safer to stay here.

The place is dark and small, with dusty stale air and a faint smell of decay.

You use your phone to illuminate the secret room. The apparition seems to be gone, but a quick glance reveals that this is a sort of storage room.

There is a small desk with a chair, surrounded by multiple chests on the ground. The walls are lined will shelves that are stacked with old parchments.

Continuing your investigation, you manage to distinguish a few things:

Right in front of the desk, there is a $in[pile of parchments that have some sort of sketches] on them, which are either maps, blueprints or something of the sort.

On a small shelf to the right there is a $in[stack of letters]. You can notice that they were sealed with wax seals, which are now broken.

In a shelf to the left you can see a $in[giant tome with ornate covers]. The thing is almost as large as the desk itself and looks incredibly rare and expensive.

$A[I doubt I could sneak those out... but perhaps I can take a quick look before anyone finds out I&#39;m here?]

You take the stack of parchments and carefully unroll the first one on the desk.

It seems to be a construction plan for a building. It doesn&#39;t take you long to realize that it&#39;s for The Crooked Elm.

$A[It doesn&#39;t look quite right though...]

While some parts of the building match the current appearance, you can see more floors than there currently are, as well as what appear to be tunnels going underground.

$A[Perhaps those were the original plans, and then they scaled down?]

You&#39;re not sure. You do notice a few interesting things about it though and you try to memorize them. If those tunnels really exist, the information would be valuable to someone.

You take the pile of letters and carefully slide the first one out of its envelope.

It&#39;s written with meticulous, perfect handwriting in a gothic font. The golden ink gives off a faint fragrance that you can&#39;t quite identify. 

You flip through the pages of the letter.

$A[Oh my...]

The suggestions are incendiary. The language is both formal and brazen. The details are graphic. This could make even a hardened wench blush like a maiden. You take the next letter. You have to know more.

By the time you&#39;ve finished the pile your blood is flowing and your cheeks are reddening in the darkness. You can&#39;t imagine anyone ever speaking to you like that... but the prospect is enticing. The images will stay with you for a while.

Turning the pages, you see that it&#39;s written in an ancient language, with runes and diagrams that resemble some of the things that you&#39;ve seen in the library.

$A[I&#39;m not sure what it says, but it resembles some sort of alchemy...]

Despite not understanding the words, you find yourself strangely compelled to keep reading line after line. Your eyes are drawn to the letters and symbols. You feel them sinking into you like needles.

Ionut doesn&#39;t flinch nor does he reciprocate your touch.

$a[&#39;A bear!? You&#39;re lucky you survived!&#39;]

You continue to stare at the servant&#39;s deformed face. By all conventional standards, Ionut is ugly, even hideous. But you find a strange attraction in his ugliness, a sensation deep within that you can&#39;t quite describe.

You will need some time to digest this. You draw your hand away from his face.

You leap forward, shoving the girl back. The chains snap from hook, rattling as she rolls away to the corner of the room.

Your moment of victory is brief, as the black tendrils are now curling up your legs. You struggle to break free, but their grip is too tight. Then the pentagram on the floor closes again and a lid falls over the world.

No voice comes out of your mouth. 

The tendrils are sliding up your body and now they have your hands. You are pinned to the floor, unable to move.

Your legs are spread apart and you can feel a dark, slimy touch creeping between them. Your heart is pounding like hammers in your chest.

Just when the panic grips you, you see that the girl in the corner has managed to somehow get out of her chains and is now up.

$A[~~&#39;Help me!&#39;~~]

She takes a few wobbly steps then seems to regain her balance. Her head turns towards you and you give her a hopeful nod.

She ignores your plea, inspecting critically the mess you&#39;ve made on the floor.

Your moment of anger is short lived however. The dark mass wraps tightly and painfully around your flesh, constricting your body. The tentacles have your arms and legs and are now coiling around your chest. You realize that whatever they were doing to the woman before was mere playful teasing. Now they are **angry**.

$A[I... can&#39;t... breathe...]

One of the tentacles finally makes its way under your $suit and into your panties. It&#39;s slimy end rubs along your slit and presses against your asshole, mounting the pressure. It&#39;s only a matter of moments before your o-ring gives in and opens up, letting the intruder slide in.

And continue sliding in.

The tentacle keeps moving forward. It&#39;s thin and flexible, with a texture that reminds you of a snail&#39;s trail. The continuous sensation of pushing in is maddening. You grit your teeth and roll your eyes, waiting for it to finally stop.

As your stomach begins to bulge, you struggle helplessly to stop the intrusion. A light headedness is starting to grip you and your vision begins to blur. The slimy tentacle is still sliding on and on into your ass and you can feel your resistance waning by the second. Your hole relaxes and another tentacle pushes in, stretching it further.

$a[&#39;So, uh, what brings you to The Crooked Elm?&#39;]

The woman slides towards the desk. Her large butt wobbles softly, almost behind her body.

$E[&#39;I&#39;ve come to seek a home for my children. The Elder has promised me help.&#39;]

$a[&#39;The Elder?&#39;] You raise an eyebrow.

$E[&#39;Mihai&#39;s father&#39;]

$a[&#39;Ah.&#39;] You pause, thinking. $a[&#39;So, he&#39;s going to pull some strings, get them a job? Perhaps here at the hotel?&#39;]

The dark woman blinks, perplexed. $E[&#39;Not a job. A home.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Yeah, I get it. Just like me!&#39;] You laugh nervously. $a[&#39;That&#39;s the good thing about working at a hotel, right? You get a bed and a roof, even a breakfast...&#39;]

The woman blinks again and taps on the desk, examining you intently. Feeling uneasy, you decide to break the tension.

$a[&#39;I hope I won&#39;t get into trouble for talking to you...&#39;] You laugh nervously.

She continues to play with your breasts and belly, pulling you back towards her. Her green lips plant a kiss on your neck and you feel her fangs bite down on your skin.

The pain lasts only for an instant, followed by a wave of warm pleasure that further relaxes all of your muscles. Her hand slides down into your crotch, finding its way under your layers of garments and on the brink of your entrance.

$E[&#39;What a good girl Mihai has chosen. I will train you to serve me well, my dear.&#39;]

You moan softly, growing wetter at her touch. The black woman has an intoxicating presence, pushing all of the right buttons and drawing you into a web of submission...

$E[&#39;My dear, how many children do you want to have? I hear humans typically have only one or two, but you could have an entire legion...&#39;]

You sit on the desk and start going through the cabinets and drawers, taking out anything of interest. Soon you are looking at a pile of parchments, a handful of letters in envelopes and what appears to be a sketchbook.

As you flip through the stack, a sketch catches your eye - it has a pentagram and a number of runes around it. Just below, there are several notes:

$sys[Summoning steps:

1. Draw the pentagram to scale.

A handful of titles from the shelves catch your eye, so you grab one of them and take a moment to flip through the pages.

The tome is dedicated to (either:&quot;protection spells&quot;,&quot;the history of arcane symbols&quot;,&quot;rune magic&quot;) and you quickly get lost in the intricate diagrams and explanations.

After a good moment of reading, you finally put the book down. (if: (history:) contains &quot;spell occult&quot;)[There isn&#39;t anything that is directly related to the girl in the other room and the symbols around her, it was probably worth the read anyways.]

Taking a moment to consider some of the assertions in the book, you are left perplexed.

You have delved deep enough into the mystic arts to handle something like this. To safely cancel a summoning, you need to perform the original ritual in reverse, but contain it within a septagram to avoid any complications.

You take the chalk and draw a large septagram as best as you can. $A[Fire is fueling this, so next are the candles!]

You start blowing out the candles one by one. Their flames flicker angrily, each one harder to stifle out then the previous one.

The last candle fights back viciously, it&#39;s flame raising up again and again despite your attempts to blow it out. Finally you spit on your fingers and pinch the wick, suffocating the flame for good.

$A[That should do it!]

The candles are now all out and you can notice a change in the behaviour of the tendrils. They seem a little more erratic and twitchy, compared to their smooth and elegant pace before. The only thing left is to break the pentagram.

You step on the edge of the pentagram and start (link-reveal:&quot;smudging the circle with your shoe.&quot;)[(set: $tent1 to &quot;C&quot;)(set: $tent2 to &quot;C&quot;)(set: $blindfold to false)(rerun:?scene)

You see the tendrils begin to flail in the air, slowly retracting back into the floor. The symbols on the floor flair up for a few seconds, then the world returns to normal. The distant whispering is gone. The spell has been broken.

$a[&#39;Here, let me help you!&#39;] You detach the girl&#39;s chains from the hook on the roof and help her to her feet.

Two radiant, violet eyes slowly blink at you.

$S[&#39;Who are you?&#39;]

The girl is looking at you with a calm curiosity that surprises you for someone that has just been rescued from infernal torture.

You dodge her gaze and your eyes fall naturally on her breasts. Big, round and full, they are the most perfect breasts you have ever seen. Her pierced nipples look like the crystallization of every man&#39;s fantasies.

You shake your head, trying to compose yourself.

There is nothing more you can do, but you remain in place, observing the dance macabre of the slithering mass of tentacles as it becomes more and more aggressive with the bound prisoner.

Watching the horrifying scene makes you inexplicably aroused and you slip a hand between your legs, beginning to rub your slit.

$A[I shouldn&#39;t be doing this, this is wrong...]

The guilt is intense, but you can&#39;t stop. There&#39;s something mezmerizing about the situation. Suddenly, the big, black tentacle (link-reveal:&quot;wraps even more tightly around the girl&#39;s neck, squeezing and suffocating her.&quot;)[
(set: $tent3 to true)
Her screams are interrupted by gasps for air, all the while her hips continue to be violated by the otherworldly tendrils.

The candles are burning bright and your own breath is quickening with the pace of your fingers. The tentacle around her throat contracts and you feel the flailing of her body, all while another thick and slimy one is pushing its way into her ass.

You close your eyes for a second, your fingers rubbing faster and faster. A powerful orgasm washes over you, making your entire body shake and shiver. When you finally open your eyes again, the girl&#39;s limp body has stopped all resistance, hanging like a lifless doll from the ceiling while the tentacles continue to ravage her.

Sabrina jumps with glee, throwing her shackles in the corner. Startled by the metallic crash, you wonder when she managed to get out of those.

$S[&#39;Let me just set the mood a little!&#39;]

She disappears out the door, leaving you alone and wondering what you got yourself into. When she returns, Sabrina is wearing a tight body suit made of leather straps and chains that reveal rather than conceal all the best parts of her body. You think you&#39;ve seen similar attires in fetish magazines, but this is really the next level.

She whips out a small crop with a piece of leather strapped at the end.

You leave the room, catching up to her. She leads you down another flight of stairs, navigating a series of hallways.

$S[&#39;Timeloops can be a little tricky to manage, but I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ve noticed that some things change every time. History is never *quite the same*.&#39;]

$a[&#39;I suppose that&#39;s true,&#39;] you agree.

$S[&#39;Do you know why?&#39;]

You shake your head.

$S[&#39;Oh, come on! it&#39;s simple - it&#39;s you! This is *your* timeline, and since you keep moving forward - in a sense - things that are intertwined with yourself can also become part of the loop&#39;]

$S[&#39;Exactly! And if you want to be sure to find me again and continue this conversation, you need to become intertwined with *me*.&#39;]

The last sentence hangs in your mind, oscillating between threat and promise. Before you have the chance to hesitate, Sabrina grabs your hand and [[drags you into a small room.]]

When she flicks a switch, the room gets illuminated by an intense white light, coming from a big lamp above. You squint your eyes, trying to gather your surroundings as your eyes adapt to the brightness.

$S[&#39;Here you go!&#39;]

Sabrina pushes you back and you fall onto a small bed in the center of the room.

$S[&#39;Get your tits out!&#39;] she commands you, while rummaging through a number of drawers on the other end. Intimidated, you dare not disobey her. With some fumbling, you get your $breasts out of your $suit.

$a[&#39;What exactly are you planning to-&#39;]

She turns around, a big metal needle in her hand. Your eyes grow big, but it&#39;s too late to run. She leans on top of you, grabbing your left nipple. With a swift movement, she pierces it.

The pain is sharp and intense and you draw a quick breath, gritting your teeth.

She does a few more precise movements and when you are able to look down, you see a $S[small piercing] on your breast.

$S[&#39;It&#39;s a special one - now we&#39;re linked,&#39;] she replies to your silent question.

Sabrina smiles at you.

You breathe a sigh of relief. She remembers, just like she said she would.

$a[&#39;As you know, one of the first creatures I encountered was the werewolf...&#39;]

You blush and trail off, clutching your hands. $A[Why is it so hard to talk about this?]

$S[&#39;Speak up, don&#39;t be shy. Werewolves are a legend among lovers, there is nothing like a night of passion under the full moon. It&#39;s like walking a razor&#39;s edge, you never know if they won&#39;t snap and tear you to pieces... but that&#39;s what makes your heart pump and your slit moisten like never before. Us girls - we live for the thrill, the danger. If a sis tells you she&#39;s not getting hot from bad boys, she&#39;s lying.&#39;] 

Sabrina&#39;s nonchalant approach to the subject matter alleviates some of your nervousness. It&#39;s clear that she&#39;s not one to shy away from sharing what brings her pleasure.

$a[&#39;When I first met him, he killed me.&#39;] you say quietly. $a[&#39;The next time he killed me again. But then we I got these pheromones...&#39;]

$S[&#39;Smart girl! Werewolves have pretty much two modes - fuck or devour. It&#39;s pretty much like men, when you think about it.&#39;] she shrugs to the world in general.

She draws a complex symbol on the floor, lights the candles and starts to chant some sort of incantation. The candlelight flickers on her lusty curves in tune with the vibrations of her voice, which becomes hollow and other worldly.

The hairs on the back of your neck begin to stand up and you are gripped with a terrible premonition.

The room suddenly grows darker, as if light itself runs to hide. The candles flicker. Sabrina&#39;s voice us an unrecognizable cacophony of unfathomable sounds. You know that something bad is going to happen. 

$A[&#39;What&#39;s going on?! This was a mistake!&#39;]

You try to run, but your body is frozen in place. The sense of impending doom grows stronger, the symbols on the floor glow and burn away the fabric of reality, opening a blackness that your eyes simply can&#39;t pierce, like nothingness itself.

A creature leaps through the portal. Your breath cuts short as the skull stares at you, the empty sockets emanating a ghoulish red glow. It has the body of a massive canine, with black fur and a short, skeletal tail.

Gwyllgi slowly paces closer towards you, his two glowing sockers promising your doom.

You swallow hard. $a[&#39;What do I do?&#39;]

An other-worldly growl shakes the air.

You stare death in its growing red sockets and slowly spread your legs apart, leaning back so your head and arms are as far away as possible.

The growl quiets down and the giant black dog accepts your invitation, thrusting its skeletal head in your crotch.

You wince back, the sense of impending doom still strong. Strangely enough there is some kind of breath coming from its nose. The bony jaws open and a black, slimy tongue gives you a lick.

Carefully, you get up from the chair, conscious of the red hollow gaze that follows your every motion. You turn your back and get down on the floor.

The waves of fear are still washing over you like a constant sound, a buzzing that you can&#39;t turn off. You are painfully aware that you have to do your best to convince the creature that you are mating material and not an early dinner.

Your get down on all fours on the cold stones of the room, taking the familiar doggy style position.

Gwyllgi&#39;s aura of doom grows stronger. You are certain that he&#39;s right behind you, his spectral breath touching the skin of your thighs.

$A[I am not food, I am not food, I am not food...!]

The black dog jumps to hump you, but the angle seems to cause some difficulty. An annoyed growl comes from the bony jaws.

$S[&#39;Head down, ass up, sis!&#39;]

You obey the command, lowering your torso down and arching your ass for easy access. Finally the sense of doom draws back and the creature steadies on you, grasping your thighs with its front paws.

$S[&#39;Well done! It seems that you&#39;ll live to fuck another day, sis.&#39;]

The dog enters you with a powerful thrust, then quickly picks up the pace. The fear is gradually replaced with pleasure and desire as you settle in a familiar role.

You find yourself deeper and deeper into the shadows, the trees around you changing from tall pines to dry, eerie corpses.

A howl tears through the night, long and piercing and, worst of all, right behind you. You switch into a sprint, running as fast as you can, but your $suit is uncomfortable for running and your feet get tangled in the extra garments you&#39;re not used to.

Your shift is almost over and you&#39;re beginning to think about your coming dinner when suddenly there is a sharp knock on the door. Before you can react the door opens and a hooded man steps in. 

He looks to be in poor shape - his clothes, clearly too big for him, are rumpled and dirty as if he&#39;d recently had a brawl in the mud with someone. Then the odor hits you - a strong, rich smell that invades the space around him, a smell of sweat and musk with a tinge of something feral behind it. $A[Wow... eh.. damn] It&#39;s not an entirely unpleasant smell either and you have to admit that concentrating on it does weird things to your head.

He takes off his hood, exposing his face - rough, unshaven, dark sunken eyes looking at you with an impenetrable stare. There&#39;s something weird about this face though, something familiar that you can&#39;t quite put your finger on.

While distant alarm bells keep ringing in your mind, the man approaches the desk.

You reach behind the desk and grab a key at random, tossing him one with the number &quot;(either:1,2)(either:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9)&quot; on it. He takes, sniffs it, then places it in his pocket.

He approaches the desk, then stops. He sniffs the air loudly, once, twice, then narrows his eyes on you.

You&#39;d like to hurry things up, so you give Ionut a hand with the shoveling. The wet soil is easy enough to work with and soon you have a hole that is almost a few feet deep.

Satisfied with the result, Ionut puts his shovel aside and produces what looks like a fishing string with a hook on the end. He then takes a severed finger out of his pocket, forces it on the hook and lowers the hook into the hole.

You rub your eyes. The scene feels surreal.

After a few seconds there is a slimy, slithering noise coming from the hole and you see the string vibrating. Ionut pulls it out, along with a black wiggling mass wrapped around the end.

$A[I wonder if the wolf will show up at all this time...? Perhaps the pheromones will keep him away...]

About halfway through the climb, you get the eerie feeling that someone is watching you. You slowly turn your head, locking eyes with the painfully familiar, distorted silhouette. You hear him breathing heavily, sniffing the air.

Still carrying you by the throat, he lifts you over the desk and heads back outside. You struggle and twist but his grip is simply too strong.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/executions/strangle.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
The garden in front of the manor is drowning in darkness, but there is a single patch of moonlight streaming through the clouds. The guest heads there and you realize what his plan is. At this point, there&#39;s nothing you can do.

He steps into the moonlight, thrusting you into the center of the spot. Within moments, his hand begins to pulse and grow and his face distorts into a bestial shape.

As his transformation is almost over, his flaming eyes focus on you.

$A[Oh shit.]

$W[&#39;LIAAARR!!!&#39;]

The monster throws you to the ground, pinning you down, its claws digging down and shredding your new clothes. Your frail, feminine body trembles in terror as the teeth sink into the delicate flesh without hesitation. There is little mercy for you this time and you convulse in agony as the beast tears off chunk after chunk, your helpless limbs flailing in the swelling pools of blood and splattering crimson spots all over the remains of your $suit.

The force is finally sapped from your body and the pain fades into a dull background. The last thing you feel is your bracelet getting warmer, before (link-reveal-goto:&quot;the darkness takes you&quot;,&quot;DIE&quot;)[(set: $lastdeath to &quot;wolfguest outside&quot;)

There is no way you can endure the wriggling of the worms one more second. You start removing your garments one by one until you are left completely naked from the waist up.

The rain falls on your skin and slides down your $breasts. The cemetery air feels cool but somehow stale and moldy, with a subtle scent of decay that is now somehow even stronger.

You shake the worms out of your clothes and get dressed again. Ionut seems unphased by the whole affair and gets back to fishing for worms without saying a word.

When the bucket is eventually full, the two of you [[head back-&gt;ionut worms return]].

Their cold, slimy touch feels strangely arousing on your naked breasts and you struggle to stay focused as you fish another batch for the bucket.

When you&#39;re done collecting the worms you head back to The Crooked Elm, but walking seems to make matters worse. The worms slide down and are now slipping around your stomach, one even getting itself in your underwear.

You shudder at the earthly touch between your legs, a touch that you have to admit arouses you with promises of grotesque and forbidden pleasures of the flesh. You wonder what it would be like to feel all the worms wriggling around you, perhaps even *inside* you...

By the time you make it back to the entrance, you feel a heat growing in your belly and a neediness that you&#39;ll have to take care of later.

Ionut heads to the basement to store the worms, giving you a quick glance.

You follow her hesitantly through the narrow gaps between piles of books and trinkets. She takes a series of turns that don&#39;t make sense in Euclidean space, which hardly surprises you at this point. 

You end up in a small... room? alcove? You are not certain. It&#39;s a space that has been cleared from the piles of *stuff*, barely big enough to hold a little table, a chair, a chest and a blanket.

$A[Is this... her place? There isn&#39;t a bed, but that blanket seems pretty comfy, and I&#39;ve never actually seen her *leave* the shop...]

Felicia takes an ornate key from her pocket and opens the chest. There is a sound of her rummaging through it, but you don&#39;t see much over her shoulder.

$M[&#39;Ah, here it is.,&#39;] she turns around, holding a large parchment that she places on the table.

You lean over it. There are a few lengthy paragraphs of tight handwriting, with the signatures at the end. The strange, squiggly characters are not in any language that you can recognize.

Felicia takes a plume and scribbles a few extra lines at the bottom, leaving a blank line for you.

The whole thing sounds a bit fishy and you begin to wonder why Felicia is not being forward with you.

She gives you a long, measuring look. $M[&#39;You see, girl, you are alive only because of that bracelet I gave you, for free.

$L[&#39;I see.&#39;] He takes a sip from the red liquid in his glass. $L[&#39;I must admit that this does not bring me full satisfaction.

He taps his fingers on the table, taking another slow sip pensively. $L[&#39;Still, the contract is being honored.

The embark on the climb back to The Crooked Elm, your head full of memories of the day and thoughts of what is to come.

It&#39;s still day, but the shade of the forest creates a cool, somber atmosphere. Somewhere in the distance birds fly off, caw-ing.

Despite the serenity of the path, you get the eerie sensation that someone is watching you.

You add a few runes around the edge of the outer circle and mutter a few phrases from the *Codex Daemonica*. The light of the pentagram shifts subtly and the tentacles start wriggling angrily.

After a few seconds the light of the pentagram shifts subtly and the tentacles start wriggling angrily.

$A[See how, **that**&#39;s like, bitch!]

The dark tentacles rise from the ground longer and thicker, wrapping tightly around the woman&#39;s body. 

Whereas before they were just rubbing and teasing, now they push aggressively into her holes, making her body shake helplessly at the intrusion.

Watching her belly expand is hypntozing. The bumps of the tentacles wriggling inside of her create ripples on her skin, her moans rising in a crescendo.

Perhaps the memory of your own demise is still fresh in your mind, or perhaps some long-hidden sadism is awakening in your heart, but the scene feels you with twisted arousal, your pussy growing wet and needy from the girl&#39;s agony.

You watch with morbid curiosity, taking in every detail of the otherworldly spectacle.

Suddenly the girl pulls violently on her chains, shattering them apart. Her voice raises over the eerie noise of the summoning, shouting in a strange language:

$unav1[$unav2[ $S[&quot;n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂Ꮈຖ໓s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂Ꮈʝǟf̴̨̤̣͍̳̣̆̒͜s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ꮈຖ໓n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂Ꮈ໓n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂🙰Ŝs̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ꮈn̸̘̣̉͐̃͂Ꮈຖ໓s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆ŜᎸŜᶠֆʄǟf̴̨̤̣͍̳̣̆̒͜s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ꮈຖ໓n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂&quot;] ] ]

The pentagram glows intensely, then the lights begin to fade and the tentacles retract back into the floor, leaving puffs of purple smoke behind.

Breathing heavily, the woman rises to her feet, removing her blindfold. Her eyes narrow on you suspiciously.

$S[&#39;Who are you and what are you doing here?&#39;]

As much as it&#39;s satisfying and arousing to watch the tentacles ravage the woman, in the end you decide to be the better person.

Luckily, you are capable to cancecel the spell. To safely interrupt a summoning, you need to perform the original ritual in reverse, but contain it within a septagram to avoid any complications.

You take the chalk and draw a large septagram as best as you can. You erase the symbols that you&#39;ve added, causing the tentacles to calm down. $A[Now, for the candles...]

You start blowing out the candles one by one. Their flames flicker angrily, each one harder to stifle out then the previous one.

The last candle fights back viciously, it&#39;s flame raising up again and again despite your attempts to blow it out. Finally you spit on your fingers and pinch the wick, suffocating the flame for good.

$A[That should do it!]

The candles are now all out and the tendrils become slow and sluggish, releasing the woman from their grip. The only thing left is to break the pentagram.

You step on the edge of the pentagram and start smudging the circle with your shoe.

You see the tendrils begin to flail in the air, slowly retracting back into the floor. The symbols on the floor flair up for a few seconds, then the world returns to normal. The distant whispering is gone. The spell has been broken.

$a[&#39;Here, let me help you!&#39;] You detach the girl&#39;s chains from the hook on the roof and remove her blindfold.

Two radiant, violet eyes slowly blink at you.

$S[&#39;Who are you?&#39;]

The girl is looking at you with a calm curiosity that surprises you for someone that has just been rescued from infernal torture.

You swallow hard and decide to write the whole thing off as an accident. From what she knows, you saved her. It&#39;s probably best to keep it that way.

You dodge her gaze and your eyes fall naturally on her breasts. Big, round and full, they are the most perfect breasts you have ever seen. Her pierced nipples look like the crystallization of every man&#39;s fantasies.

You shake your head, trying to compose yourself.

$L[&#39;Welcome back. Did you have fun?&#39;]

Lavius is waiting on the side of the table, carrying your clothes in a bundle. Your chains have already been unlocked, allowing you to slowly get up from the table.

$a[&#39;How long was I...?&#39;]

$L[&#39;Not too long. I asked the men to give you some space once they were done.&#39;]

You look at Lavius&#39; charming smile, his eyes peering at you with something resembling care and compassion. It&#39;s nothing like the person he was before. It feels surreal.

You take the clothes and get dressed, slowly heading towards the exit of the inn.

$L[&#39;Pass my regards to our mutual acquaintance, will you? Tell her .... tell her I am profoundly saddened that she has missed the opportunity to repay her debts in person, but I shall nevertheless consider it resolved.&#39;]

Lavius escorts you to the door, holding you for a moment. He looks down, brushing a cum stain from your cheek. $L[&#39;We shall meet again.&#39;]

You walk slowly, taking the time to breathe in the forest and rest. It&#39;s not a time to hurry.

(if: $weather is &quot;rainy&quot;)[As you make your way up the mountain, a light summer rain begins to fall, turning the dusty trail into a light brown. You raise your eyes to the sky - a handful of grey clouds are hovering over the mountain peaks.

$A[That&#39;s odd, I don&#39;t think it rained the last time round... I hope this doesn&#39;t turn into a storm.]

You can&#39;t spot anyone, but it&#39;s like someone is watching, always behind you.

There is a sense in the air, like a premonition that something bad is going to happen.

$A[Of course something bad is going to happen to a stupid girl like me, walking through the forest all alone...]

The thought pops all alone in your head. You are suddenly aware of your vulnerability. $A[Anything could happen here...]

The forest feels strange. Something is off. You are starting to become scared. Worse still, you&#39;re getting wet from it. Colors shift and shapes twist subtly.

You need to run. Now.

There is something incredibly exciting in deliberately slowing your pace down. Whatever is lurking in the shadows could surely catch up to you now.

Your heart is beating in your chest, an undeniable moisture growing between your legs. The sense of doom is getting stronger.

As you peer in the shade between the pines, a pair of red glowing eyes stare back at you...

You freeze for a moment like a fawn in the headlights, then a somewhat familiar horror creeps closer towards you. It&#39;s a an overwhelming sensation of worthlessness and excitement, of the blind suicidal euphoria of a moth bumping over and over against the heated bulb.

$A[I know that feeling...I think he&#39;s friendly, but if I&#39;m not careful, I might still end up used... in some way...]

The sense of doom is still very strong, but you know what to do. Sabrina&#39;s training kicks in and you follow your instincts, showing your subservience to the Omeon of Death.

You get down on all fours, letting the demonic dog come and sniff your crotch. $G[Worthless...meat...] He seems to recognize you and his head transforms from a skull to something almost normal, barring his two hollow eyes, glowing red.

$A[Why are you here ...? Did you come for me? Or did I wander in your way...?]

Gwyllgi sniffs you some more and doesn&#39;t give any indication of his intentions one way or the other, but you are already feeling the seeds of temptation sprouting in your mind.

$A[I really shouldn&#39;t... this is wrong...]

Still on all fours, you wait for the uncanny creature to lose interest and be on its way. Instead, he comes and starts licking your face.

&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/kissofdeath.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The sense of doom returns, albeit with a different taste than before. You feel a strange mixture of arousal and danger as the sky becomes greyer and the shadows rise.

You patiently endure the otherworldly creature&#39;s strange tongue on your face, gently shooing him away.

Eventually Gwyllgi loses interest in you and runs back into the forest. As soon as he&#39;s gone, the forest seems to warp back to normal. Colors return to their usual greys and the shapes are no longer dancing in the corner of your eye. 

You breathe a big sigh of relief.

After a while you come back to your normal self, the thought of what just happened filling you with mixed emotions.

Total and complete darkness. 

But this time it&#39;s warm.

You can hear voices in the void.

You begin to walk a path that is not a path. It&#39;s going forward and backwards, outside and then, inside.

You emerge at a threshold where the path splits up and down.

$S[Choose what you want to change, sis,] comes a familiar voice from nowhere and everywhere.

You reach out and touch the white flower, admiring its slender beauty.

The moment your hand wraps around it, it bursts into flames, disintegrating into dust, along with the garden around it.

You are left in the dark void again, floating into nothingness.

A warm, tingling sensation wraps your body. Suddenly you feel your legs starting to grow. They stretch slowly, becoming leaner and thinner. Suddenly your thighs aren&#39;t touching anymore and you feel your gap completely exposed.

Even in the solitude of eternal darkness, you blush and try to hide it, but to no avail. You feel as if the entire universe is can see your open sex and you will never again be able to hide it.

The sense of doom is still very strong, but you know what to do. You get down on all fours, letting the demonic dog come and sniff your crotch.

He seems to recognize you and his head transforms from a skull to something resembling almost a normal dog, if it weren&#39;t for the two hollow eyes glowing red.

$A[Why are you here, boy? Did you come for me?]

Gwyllgi sniffs you some more and doesn&#39;t give any indication of his intentions one way or the other, but you are already feeling the seeds of temptation sprouting in your mind.

$A[I really shouldn&#39;t... this is wrong...]

Still on all fours, you wait for the creature to lose interest and be on its way. Instead, he comes and starts licking your face.

You patiently endure the otherworldly creature&#39;s strange tongue on your face, gently shooing him away.

Eventually the creature loses interest in you and runs back into the forest.

Sabrina pushes you back and you fall onto a small bed in the center of the room.

With some fumbling, you get your $breasts out of your $suit. You are feeling excited and a little aroused.

She turns around, a big metal needle in her hand. Sabrina leans on top of you, grabbing left nipple and piercing it with a swift movement.

The pain is sharp and intense and you draw a quick breath, gritting your teeth.

She does a few more precise movements and when you are able to look down, you see a $S[small piercing] on your breast.

The black woman&#39;s smile stretches into a sadistic grin.

The pain is sharp and instant. Elise&#39;s hand darts between your legs, fondling your slit. $E[&#39;Are you wet from just that, tsk? Fine. I shall give you what you want... if you beg for it.&#39;]

You shift a little uneasily, your head still dizzy from the recent experience. But something in that woman draws you in and incites you to throw caution to the wind like never before.

$a[&#39;P-please...&#39;] you say in a small voice, lifting your eyes up at her. Elise is so much taller than you are, and her presence has a way of filling the room.

$E[&#39;Remove your clothes, girl.&#39;]

You follow her command, slipping out of your $suit. The only thing left on you are your $piercing piercings which decorate your $breasts. More then ever, you feel their impact on your body, bringing out your most submissive side.

The evening is progressing and you begin to wonder if the werewolf will be showing up tonight after all.

Finally, there is a sharp knock on the door. It creaks open and the tattered figure steps in, breathing heavily.

$A[I wonder what he was up to this time...?]

He approaches the desk, then stops. He sniffs the air loudly, once, twice, then narrows his eyes on you.

$W[&#39;You smell... **funny**. Mihai didn&#39;t mention that one of ours was working at the hotel.&#39;] 

You bite your lip. You had completely forgotten about the pheromones.

The wolf chuckles, taking another long puff from his cigar.

$W[&#39;Why did you bring me out here, huh? What do you want?&#39;]

You swallow hard, trying to compose your thoughts and come up with a good answer before this goes sideways.

You dart to the pile and find $Io[Ionut], lying on the floor. Shocked, you try to shake him, but he doesn&#39;t react. His body is cold to the touch and you can&#39;t detect a pulse, but it&#39;s hard to say if that&#39;s normal for him or not.

$A[He&#39;s either dead or unconscious.... what the fuck&#39;s going on here?]

On the opposite side of the room there is another $in[door] leading further down... and it seems to be open.

When you approach, you notice faint eachoes coming from below.

The servant turns his face towards you. $Io[&#39;Vank you, Miss Alexandra. I am going gardening. Vould you like to come?&#39;]

You give him a nod, flip the sign at the reception and follow him outside.

The two of you follow the path around the manor as the sky darkens to dusk. Ionut quickens the pace, heading towards the far end of the garden.

You reach the cemetery gates at the end of the garden. Ionut takes out his $in[keychain] and unlocks the padlock, pushing the gates open with a creak of the rusty hinges.

Beyond the gate you follow the servant down a stony path that leads into the cemetery. Ancient tombstones line on both sides, their engravings faded and illegible. 

$Io[&#39;Ve are alvost there.&#39;]

The servant takes a turn from the main path towards a patch of ground that looks freshly dug.

$Io[&#39;Now ve ig a little hole.&#39;]

Ionut pushes his shovel into the mud, excavating a sizable chunk of soil. You watch him work, fascinated by the process. You didn&#39;t notice this last time, but there is something deeply ominous about the whole scene.

The wind is howling among the ancient pines in the distance, the ridges of the mountain growing darker by the minute. You can swear that the earth beneath is pulsing, awoken by every scoop of the shovel.

$a[&#39;Are these worms everywhere, Ionut?&#39;] you ask mesmerized.

$Io[&#39;Vat? No, only in cemetery. They come from ze crypt.&#39;] He points a finger to a decrepit stone mass in the distance. $Io[&#39;But don&#39;t go in ze crypt. The vurms  too big. Here vurms small - good for catch.&#39;]

Still keeping your eyes on $I[the crypt], you swear that you can feel a slight pull towards it, like *an appel du vide* from standing at a high ledge, just over the abyss.

$Io[&#39;Time to catch some vurms!&#39;] comes the servant&#39;s voice, snapping you out of the strange feeling.

Much like last time, Ionut produces a fishing pole and takes a $in[severed finger] out of his pocket, lowering it as bait into the hole.

After a few seconds there is a slimy, slithering noise from the hole and the string vibrates, prompting Ionut to pull it out, along with a black wiggling mass of worms wrapped around the bait.

$Io[&#39;Vould you like to try?&#39;] asks the servant, dropping the gruesome catch into the metal bucket. You take over from him, pinning another severed finger on the hook before proceeding to a dangle the string down into the hole.

$A[How did I end up doing this...]

Small scarce raindrops continue to soak the cemetery grounds as you fish one wriggling mass after another from the desecrated ground. The slimy creatures are pitch black and almost an elbow long, threatening to make their way out of the iron bucket if it wasn&#39;t for the lures keeping them occupied.

You have gotten good enough at it not to get them all over yourself this time. But then again, your hand could slip...

$a[&#39;I&#39;ll be right behind you, Ionut, go ahead. I just need to check... something...&#39;]

Your small voice sounds unconvincing even to yourself, but nevertheless the servant gives you a nod and heads back to the manor.

You turn around and head down the stony path among the graves. There is something pulling you, an invisible *longing* that beckons you further and further towards the ruins of the crypt.

As you walk the path you have the strange feeling that something is mirroring your movements, something underground sliding along with you. You feel its presence at the back of your mind, innately understood through senses that you can&#39;t describe nor comprehend.

Finally, the crypt is upon you. It&#39;s entrance open like a stone maw, there is no door nor lock to stop you. Just a gaping mouth and stairs down into the darkness.

$G[Come....]

As the hairs on your skin stand on edge and your blood turns to chills, you know with absolute certainty that nothing good will come of this.

You ignore the strange feeling for now and compose yourself.

$A[I can always come and explore the crypt later...]

The rain falls on your skin and slides down your $breasts. The cemetery air feels cool but somehow stale and moldy, with a subtle scent of decay that is now somehow even stronger.

With a morbid delight, you give in to the dark impulse and slowly yet deliberately begin your descent. 

The stone staircase is winding down in big, slow turns. You can&#39;t quite decide if it&#39;s a straight spiral downwards, or it&#39;s leading you off somewhere else.

Surprisingly enough, there are torches on the walls here and there, though they do little more than punctuate the growing darkness. The steps are littered with pebbles and soil, as well as the occasional piece of bone.

$A[Did someone drag this down from the cemetery...?]

With every step, you can feel a strange tension rising. The air feels thick and heavy, every breath filling you with the taste of damp soil... and something else. You begin to feel $A[dizzy] and slightly disoriented.

In a rare moment of lucidity, you decide to stop this madness. You turn your back to the crypt.

$A[No, Alex! You are better than this! There&#39;s nothing good for you there.]

And yet, you can&#39;t bring yourself to step away. The call is there, pulling you down into the darkness. $G[You want this...]

You try to resist again. You can leave. Just take one step..

Suddenly you feel something cold and slimy touch your foot.

You stand frozen, holding your breath. Your heart is pounding like crazy. The slimy thing coils up your leg like a snake, methodically exploring the new territory. Soon it reaches your loins and you feel the tip burrow between your legs, following your dripping juices.

For a moment, the creature stops. You take a deep breath, filling your lungs with the cool mountain air. Then the worm contracts with colossal strength, pulling you [[down into the soft soil drunk&lt;-down into the darkness]].

An increasing number of *them* are converging towards you, coming in from all directions.  It feels like the earth all around you is moving and shifting. Some of them begin to emerge more and more, sliding between your legs and caressing your breasts.

The anticipation is building in your chest with every breath. Time feels like a distant memory in the total darkness of the cavernous space, where all of your sensations are heightened to the extreme.

You can taste the earth on your tongue. You can hear the soil shifting as the creatures tunnel through it. You can smell them too - an intense, saturated smell of death and decay.

You decide to hold the pole steady, not getting any of the nasty worms on yourself. But by the time the bucket is full and Ionut is ready to leave, you feel a small disappointment building in you.

$A[Was I expecting something more...?]

It&#39;s almost completely dark now and Ionut is ready to leave. However there&#39;s another, silent voice that&#39;s beckoning your attention towards the ruins of $in[the crypt].

$A[After all, why not...]

You swing the string towards the bucket, but this time right over yourself, splashing a handful of worms directly in your cleavage.

Your body electrifies with goosebumps as  they wiggle down between your breasts and under your clothes. Then comes the adrenaline rush. There is a mixture of revulsion and morbid curiosity. 

$Io[&#39;Are you alright, Miss Alexandra?&#39;]

Ionut looks concerned. You try not to give away too much from your expression.

There&#39;s no way to pull them out one by one, you&#39;d need to remove the your $suit for that. The only question is whether to do it right now in the rain and front of Ionut, or wait until you&#39;re back at the hotel...

Your small voice sounds unconvincing even to yourself, but nevertheless the servant gives you a nod and heads back to the manor.

You wait for him to leave and take a deep breath. You know you should probably remove all those creatures from underneath your clothes... but instead turn around and head down the stony path among the graves. There is something pulling you, an invisible *longing* that beckons you further and further towards the ruins of the crypt.

As you walk the path with the worms crawling around your breasts, it all feels so $A[delightfully wrong]. You have the strange feeling that the worms are enjoying it too. 

Then... there is something else. Something is mirroring your movements, something underground sliding along with you. You feel its presence at the back of your mind, innately understood through senses that you can&#39;t describe nor comprehend.

Suddenly, the crypt is upon you. It&#39;s entrance open like a stone maw, there is no door nor lock to stop you. Just a gaping mouth and stairs down into the darkness.

The figures float in the void all around you, whispering and beckoning for you.

Dressed in white, you stumble through the ruins of the old cathedral, a full moon rising over the crumbling walls.

Your steps send hollow echoes as you make your way further, the night draft lifting your veil and sending a cool kiss on the naked skin between your legs.

You feel like a complete woman now.

The only thing remaining is someone to take charge of you.

In front of you 3 shadows appear in the night, silent and deadly, yet somehow familiar. 

Tall, solemn and brooding, the first one passes in front of you, pausing to lift your chin up with the end of his $Mi[golden cane], examining your face.

Then comes the second, grinning with confidence, a mix of lust and cruelty in his eyes. He takes a $L[sip from his glass] and flings a few crimson droplets at you, letting them slide between your busty breasts.

Finally the third shadow approaches, gigantic and monstruous, with $R[two large wings and flaming eyes] the pierce right through you. The creature examines you silently from head to toe, then steps away.

You bow your eyes down, waiting. Suddenly, you feel a sharp pull...

The ground underneath you begins to glow and you see a crimson pentagram taking shape, its borders surrounded by forgotten symbols of lust and depravity. On four of its tips there are chains spruting up, while the fifth, right in front of you, has a heavy metal collar, open and waiting.

$a[&#39;I know you are scheming something for tonight, so wanted to talk to the mermaid to get more information,&#39;] you say in a slow, detached voice, your eyes pinned on the mermaid&#39;s enigmatic smile.

$L[&#39;I see. Clever girl. But not **that** clever. Does Mihai know?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I haven&#39;t told him anything.&#39;]

$L[&#39;Excellent.&#39;]

The mermaid makes a small circle in the water, still shining her radiant smile at you. You can see sparkly bubbles coming out of her mouth. Everything is incredibly beautiful.

$L[&#39;I have to admit that when I first saw you today, I thought Mihai had gotten us a piece of entertainment for the evening. But it turns out the old man still had a trick up his sleeve. I will need to do something about that.&#39;]

A finger runs down your cheek, gently caressing it.

$L[&#39;Quite the detective, aren&#39;t you?&#39;]

The mermaid waves at you, blowing you a kiss with some bubbles. You feel little butterflies in your stomach and giggle, blowing her a kiss back.

There&#39;s water and darkness in all directions, but none of that matters. What&#39;s important is that you are getting closer to those beautiful blue eyes, the eyes of the most perfect woman you have ever seen.

$N[&#39;Come, do not be afraid.&#39;]

You take her hand and she pulls you closer. Finally you can see her clearly from up close. It&#39;s like she&#39;s shining a light through the water.

The two of you get up from the bench and Lavius takes you around the side of the manor. You recognize the familiar door to the basement. He takes a look around and the two of you sneak in.

$a[&#39;Why the whole secrecy?&#39;] you ask, sneaking in after him.

$L[&#39;Don&#39;t worry about it, dear. You will understand everything in a moment.&#39;]  

The air in the basement is cool and slightly damp. Despite the time of day, it&#39;s almost dark in here, what little light there is coming from the door to the garden and the handful of torches hanging on the walls.

Lavius goes to the box and removes the lid, letting it fall to the side. You weren&#39;t expecting to get straight to that, leaving you slightly confused.

$L[&#39;Well, are you just going to stand there, my dear? You wanted to see a mermaid - come see her!&#39;]

Her lips are both sweet and salty, her hair floating around your face like seaweed. You feel all of her wrapping around you, around your arms and legs, around your body.

Her kiss is strong and biting, sharp teeth playing with your lips and muddying the water around with a tinge of red.

$N[&#39;Do you want to feel something amazing?&#39;] asks the beautiful voice. $N[&#39;You are pretty, so I will give you something... special.&#39;]

You feel something long wrap around your throat, tightening its grip. The beautiful woman kisses you again and slides a hand between your legs. Her fingers feel like ecstasy as she begins to play with you, propelling you right till the edge.

$N[&#39;Be a good girl, now... you only get 1 try.&#39;]

She smiles at you with the face of an angel and the grip on your throat tightens. You can see more bright bubbles filling the water and you realize that they&#39;re coming from you, so many bubbles. Her fingers plunge inside of you and your body tenses, riding a wave of pleasure.

$N[&#39;DO IT NOW!&#39;] comes her voice, booming and commanding, the tentacle squeezing the last gasps of air out of your throat.

Your body shakes, giving in to an orgasm as your lungs fill with water.

Elise paces around, her eight black legs dancing elegantly as she moves. You suddenly realize that telling her about Felicia might not have been the smartest thing to do.

$A[&#39;If I&#39;m not careful, I could get Felicia into some serious trouble...&#39;]

The spider&#39;s gaze narrows on you. You sense your wiggle room growing narrower.

The spider&#39;s fangs dart in a flash, and you feel a burning sensation in your neck. The world grows blurry and your body feels weak. You try to run but your limbs fold like spaghetti and you collapse on the floor.

The last thing you remember is being wrapped in something soft and dragged off down the hallway as you slowly [[lose consciousness]].(set: _ti to 8)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1198" name="defend felicia2" tags="floor2e" position="7562,8577" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$fl2&lt;/div&gt;

$E[&#39;Tsk. Do you think she hides away in that box of hers just for fun?&#39;]

You try to thread carefully with your next words.

$a[&#39;She isn&#39;t like you, Elise. You are big and strong, and you are cunning... you can take care of anyone that tries to get in your way.&#39;]

Elise seems flattered by your words.

$E[&#39;I guess you are right... when you are something as soft and squishy as a cat, I guess we can be gracious and allow some minor mischief...&#39;]

You seem to have pacified Elise, at least for now.

$E[&#39;Thank you for your thoughts, demon girl. Now I understand why you were able to see me. But perhaps it would be better for everyone if I made a few changes.&#39;]

Your vision tilts and a familiar silvery fog washes over your mind. You blink fast, trying to shake off the wave of confusion. Suddenly, a female silhouette is standing in front of you, her green spectacles reflecting a light that doesn&#39;t exist.

$E[&#39;This is better, isn&#39;t it my dear?&#39;]

You look at the furry creature, trying to determine if it&#39;s trying to make some sort of joke.

$a[&#39;Uhm, thank you...?&#39;]

The cat seems to smirk at you. $M[&#39;Still, freedom comes at a cost. Once you are out of the loop, you will lose the safety that it provides. You cannot go back. Have you learned enough to proceed?&#39;]

Thinking about, you realize that the cat is right. There is still more that you can learn. And knowledge is power. Now that you know how to navigate around danger... it doesn&#39;t hurt to stay a while longer. 

You approach the large window door - it leads on to a balcony. The full moon basks the manor and surrounding forest in a shower of silver rays and the black dead branches creak in the gusts of wind.

Here from the attic, the fall is surprisingly high, you remark as you stand up on the railing. The cobblestones on the ground below are hard and thick. You seem to have made up your mind.

Your descent is quick and silent. Your body breaks on impact, leaving a crimson splash on the black and silver canvas of the night. Darkness (link-reveal-goto:&quot;takes you.&quot;,&quot;DIE&quot;)[

You stare into the emptiness of the attic hallway, then shrug and head to your room. It&#39;s been a long and eventful day and now you long for it to be over.

As you place your hand on the door knob, a voice comes over your shoulder:

Yawning from the long and exhausting day, you put the few pages of your manuscript in the drawer and blow out the candle. 

The room plunges in silver darkness, the silhouettes outlined by the shine of the almost full moon outside. You lie on the hard mattress, thinking about the mysterious events of the day. The bracelet is hanging comfortably around your wrist, its presence somehow comforting against the creaking of the old building and the howling of the wind in the dead branches outside.

You slowly bend your neck upwards, coming face to face with the head of a giant spider, its many eyes black gleaming at you like gemstones. Her fangs hang relaxed and you sense more curiosity than danger, but the sight still makes the hairs on your skin stand on edge.

You stare into the emptiness of the attic hallway, then shrug and head to your room. It&#39;s been a long and eventful day and now you long for it to be over.

As you place your hand on the door knob, a voice comes over your shoulder:

You slow down your pace, the trill of the moment overcoming your reason.

$A[I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually doing this...]

Under the rising moon you stand on your knees, pleasuring a creature that changes with every minute before your eyes, straying farther and farther from human. You feel the texture morph in your mouth as the member grows and becomes more bestial. It is something that you really shouldn&#39;t be doing, but that thought only drives further the fire in your belly.

A powerful hand lifts up the top of your $suit, nudging you over the line of caution and reason. You pause for a moment and quickly disrobe, indulging into the absurdity of it all. It&#39;s liberating and exhilarating. Naked under the moonlight, guided only by desire.

The creature emits a piercing howl into the night, though you are uncertain if it&#39;s a cry of pleasure or a call from its bestial side. A shiver of excitement washes over you and you place a hand on its leg, feeling the tensing muscles and the thickening fur.

Suddenly another howl answers the call, somewhere close and just behind. A shadow leaps out from the trees and the wolf jumps on top of you, mouth open and drooling with excitement.

You double your efforts, pleasing the creature as if your life depends on it. The thrill makes your heart pump faster and as the werewolf&#39;s powerful hand grasps your hair you feel a pleasant lightheadedness and a warmth in your belly.

In a short while it begins growling and grasps you tighter, a long warm load emptying in your throat. The bracelet glows hot on your wrist as it absorbs the energy. 
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/wwbj2.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

The creature finally pulls its enormous member out of your mouth, giving you room to breathe. The fresh mountain air feels pleasant on your burning body. You look up to the hideous creature with an overt longing in your $eyes. It looks away and runs off into the darkness of the woods, leaving you wet and frustrated.

After a while you get up on your feet and come to your senses. You are alone.

You lower your back in an arch and move your legs apart, allowing the wolf to slip easily inside you.

$A[Aaah...]

There is a feeling of stretching, followed by fullness as he makes his way inside all the way. The front paws of the beast lock over your hips, holding you tightly in place as it begins to pound.

Noticing your distracted moans, the werewolf grabs a fistful of your hair and pulls your face back towards him, demanding attention. You can see that he&#39;s twitching with excitement and ready to burst.

As if under a spell, you lean in and wrap your $lips around the tip, gently kissing it. It feels ready to burst. In a moment of pure lust and insanity, you reach and grab his balls with your hand, squeezing them gently.

The werewolf growls in pleasure and suddenly bursts, overflowing your mouth with sticky white semen that begins to drip down your chin and onto your naked breasts.

As the wolf&#39;s pace accelerates from behind you begin to moan again, smaller squirts splashing over your face. Then the wolf locks in place and you feel him empty his load inside of you.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/double_ww.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

When it&#39;s all done he hops off and the two beasts walk away into the darkness of the forest.

As you slowly come back to your senses you realize that you are all covered in sticky white spots and dirt from the ground. You were wise to remove your clothes after all - cleaning yourself is easier than washing your $suit.

You are still close to the creek that flows by the side of the road, so you decide to take a quick dip in the cool waters. It&#39;s not deep enough to swim, but you can submerge your arms and legs and splash water over your breasts, cleansing most of the fluids.

After a quick air-drying you put your $suit back on, feeling lucky that it&#39;s still a summer night. With the clock ticking, you make haste back to the hotel.

The spider woman comes into full view, her green glasses looking down on you with sinister curiosity.

$E[&#39;Tsk, tsk. What a surprise. What happened here?&#39;] She extends one of her long arms and touches the tip of your horns, giving it a little tug. You feel the movement deep into the roots of your skull, an completely new sensation that overwhelms you with the visceral reality of your changing body. You pull away from her, throwing a few strands of hair to cover your horns.

$E[&#39;Look at you, tsk. What a mess you&#39;ve become, my pet. If I asked you to undress-&#39;]

Not waiting for her to finish the sentence you drop your $suit to ground, letting Elise have a good look of your $breasts with stiff, aroused nipples. You take a step forward, ready and willing, but she stops you with a hand on your shoulder.

$E[&#39;Not so fast, girl. Turn around-&#39;] You swirl on command, obeying without thinking. $E[&#39;Tsk, you really are **pathetic**. You must be so, so hungry, poor thing...]

You get down on all fours and crawl towards her. The silky smoothnes of the carpet feels nice on your skin, rousing distant memories at the back of your head.

Reaching Elise you take her leg in your hand and kiss it, letting your saliva drool down her toes. Her skin feels hard and coarse, but you don&#39;t mind.

$a[&#39;Please, mistress, use me as you wish...&#39;] you whimper needily, the heat in your belly becoming unbearable. 

There is a haze clouding your mind. You look up to the black creature and she looks down, ~~8~~2 black eyes with a green metallic sheen, staring at you with a mix of pity and satisfaction.

You place your head down and the collar snaps around your neck, locking into place. The chains jump to your wrists and ankles, pulling you down to the pulsating pentagram.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/succ1.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
(display:&quot;unav&quot;)

You can hear distant whispering, coming from beyond dreams and reason. Your flesh becomes hotter still and suddenly you realize that you are past the point of no return. 

Pleasure overwhelms you and you come into a climax, shaking into an orgasm as two powerful wings sprout from your back, along with a tail from the base of your spine.

$A[Aaah....]

Your sense of control is slipping. You are now a succubus - it is a fact that you know and understand innately. Your body has changed, but so has your mind. You feel your former logic and reason muffled, pushed down by the necessities of lust and desire.

$R[You must feed. You must be used.]

You are alone in the darkness, your naked body longing to be touched. The desire is so strong it&#39;s physically painful. Your thoughts are being railroaded, every memory, every feeling, every fragment of your being pulled towards a singular purpose.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/succ2.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
The pentagram beneath you glows and silhouettes begin to appear from all directions, surrounding you.

(display:&quot;unav&quot;), says a voice to your left. 

(display:&quot;unav&quot;), responds another.

They sound strange, yet familiar. Are there people you&#39;ve met ? Strangers, lovers, friends?

You try to look around and see who they are, but the chain on your collar is pulled down, bending your head to the floor.

$A[That&#39;s right... it doesn&#39;t matter who they are. Doesn&#39;t matter if I know them. Complete strangers or past lovers... friends or mortal enemies...]

You spread your legs obediently, waiting to fulfil your purpose. A succubus needs sustenance. Choice is no longer a matter.

The first one gets a hold of your hips and begins to pound you quick and fast, his movements as frenzied as the burning thoughts in your head. As you feel the semen burst inside of you there is an immediate feeling of bliss and satisfaction that leaves your eyes rolling while you moan in ecstasy.

As the next one comes you let your head rest on the floor, the red glow of the pentagram filling your vision as your body is taken over and over by whoever pleases. A thin line of drool flows from your lips and onto the scarlet runes. All thoughts give way to pure, [[hedonistic pleasure]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1240" name="hedonistic pleasure" tags="" position="8742,499" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt;

The night is filled with lust and darkness.

As you sleep, shameless moans escape your lips. Like frozen cherries, they are sweet and red and so ripe and ready for every kiss you dream of. Your breasts, soft and pale, with hard nipples waiting to be pinched and bitten.

You dream of demons and chains, of being taken by monsters and men as your hands clench the sheets of your bed. In your visions you are a succubus, cursed to be forever a slave of your carnal desires. 

The moon makes its way across the sky. Soon you will have [face the day]&lt;chap|.

You make a step forward into the light of the full moon, letting the glow reflect off of your naked skin. 

Up close, the wolf-man is much larger than you, his body continuing to morph and grow under your gaze. He pushes you down on the grass and leaps on top, his weight pressing you down in place as his immense member slides inside of you, stretching your body to its limit.

$W[&#39;Aaaarghoooooooouulll!!&#39;]

His cry turns into a howl, piercing the night. As he loses his last features of humanity, his movements become even more primal and uninhibited, his powerful muscles treating your body as a rag doll.

Suddenly his jaws sink into your left arm and bite it clean off, devouring the whole of it with a few fast crunching sounds. There is no pain, only surprise and some weird mesmerism of the situation. As he bites into your second arm you feel as if time goes in slow motion, the crimson droplets of blood hanging in the air before falling on your naked back.

Taken by hunger, the beast snaps your legs as well, one after the other, like a tiny snack in his gargantuan belly. You are left lying with 4 stumps, with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Returning to its sexual appetites, the creature humps your now quadriplegic body, relieving the rest of its desires and leaving you to lie in a pool of blood and semen, white and crimson shining equally bright under the full moon.

$E[&#39;There&#39;s a good girl,&#39;] she chuckles, tracing a hand on your skin. Her nails feel hard and sharp, leaving small marks along your $breasts.

Her ~~multiple~~ arms descend all around you, enveloping your body in caresses. Her large, round abdomen lowers down, positioning in front of your opening. *Something* extends further, pushing into you as the ~~creature~~ woman continues to caress you.

$a[&#39;Aahh!&#39;] You give a soft moan, sensing it sink deeper.

$E[&#39;Hold steady, girl! Just like that, tsk.&#39;]

Your vision blurs and your eyes roll, giving in to sensation and pleasure. Something fills you up, over and over again, so abundant that the pressure inside you grows and stretches your womb. The bracelet glows on your wrist and you feel your **hunger** finally begin to satiate. It is the most incredible and rewarding feeling.

$a[&#39;Please, more...!&#39;]

$E[&#39;Tsk, greedy girl. That&#39;s enough for now...&#39;]

You feel a final squirt inside of you and the ~~spider~~ woman climbs down, leaving you panting on the bed.

As you linger at the reception, you hear the sound of approaching footsteps, followed by guests arriving from different directions. Everyone seems to be gathering at the front, waiting for something.

You stand behind the reception desk, tapping your fingers on the dusty wooden surface. You have a pretty good idea where this is going, but there isn&#39;t anything much you can do right now.

Brief chatter fills the air as Elise, Lavius, Ionut and the werewolf exchange pleasantries, growls and grins at one another.

You hang behind the desk, dodging the occasional side glances from the guests. With every passing minute you feel a sense of urgency to act, yet you don&#39;t know what you could possibly do. The course of events seems set, at least for now.

A few more minutes pass and you hear the familiar tapping of a golden cane, heralding the arrival of Mihai. He walks slowly down the stairs, dressed as impeccably as ever, his gaze taking in his guests one by one.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$Mi[&#39;I see that you&#39;ve all gathered - good. I trust that you&#39;ve had a pleasant stay and spent the day catching up to old friends. And I promise, there will be more time for that tomorrow - you are all my guests to stay. But now there are more pressing matters, matters you are all already familiar with. Shall we proceed?&#39;]

With a wave of smiles and nods, the guests make way for Mihai, who crosses the reception area and heads towards the front door. He pauses for a moment, then turns towards you:

$Mi[&#39;You should come too, demon. You can stay with Ionut until we are done. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll appreciate the company.&#39;]

With this, Mihai leaves and the guests follow him one by one. At last, the servant pauses at the door, gesturing you to follow him.

You emerge into the cool evening air, walking side by side with Ionut several paces behind the rest.

The sun has just set behind the mountain ridges and the garden is swimming into the quiet dusk. As the group walks down the path through the garden, you realise that you can see surprisingly well in the dark.

The silhouettes of your companions create an eerie, surreal feeling to the scene: Ionut, limping forward with that odd walk of his, giving away the unnatural angles and shapes of his limbs; Mihai and Lavius, both leading the way with a soft and elegant step that, now that you look a little closer, appears to be barely leaving a mark on the dry grass of the garden; then there is the other pair - the spider and the wolf - moving silently some distance from another, their proportions hinting to their true, inhuman nature.

$A[I guess I&#39;m the only human here-] you think for a second, before realization hits you. $A[Oh.]

A soft breeze blows through the pine trees, releasing their rich scent. It reminds you of your first walk up the stream when you arrived. $A[So much has changed since then, it seems. Alexandra, what did you get yourself into?&#39;]

The short walk is over as Mihai arrives at the entrance to the basement and ushers the guests down the stairs.

$Mi[&#39;Ionut, please  make sure we are not disturbed until the meeting is over. The young succubus can stay with you.&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Very vell, Mr. Petrescu.&#39;] The servant nods to Mihai and grabs a nearby shovel, taking a stance. After a few moments he scratches his bald head and turns towards you. $Io[&#39;Ve could sit in the basement, if you wish. Or ve could stay outside.&#39;](if: $elder_arrival is 1)[

$a[&#39;Let&#39;s stay outside for now,&#39;] you say, taking a deep breath of the fresh evening air.

Ionut nods and leans on the wall, silently contemplating the darkening sky.

Everything seems so peacuful. Then you remember what is to come - blood and violence, fangs and claws. $A[What happened last time? Who started the fight?]

It&#39;s hard to tell. You found Ionut&#39;s cold body on the outside, and a bloodbath in the room in the basement. It&#39;s clear that you are missing pieces of the puzzle.

Minutes pass and nothing much seems to happen. Dusk turns into night and Ionut rolls a cigar, taking slow puffs in the stillness of the mountain. Somewhere in the forest an owl hoots.

(if: $deathlist contains &quot;brigands&quot;)[$A[Dammit, everything will just repeat again...]

$a[&#39;Alright, let&#39;s go in,&#39;] you say, eyeing the darkening forest.

Ionut nods and heads to the basement, holding the door for you before following in himself.

There are a handful of torches illuminating the stone-tiled room. You notice that the box in the center is no longer there - Mihai and the guests must have taken it with them to the basement. For the moment, it is quiet and peacful - the only sound being the crackling of the torches. Then you remember what is to come - blood and violence, fangs and claws. $A[What happened last time?

It&#39;s hard to tell. You found Ionut&#39;s cold body on the floor, and a bloodbath in the room deeper down the hallway. It&#39;s clear that you are missing pieces of the puzzle.

Battling with the growing sensation of confusion, you try to focus on the round white object in the corner of the room. Your head begins to feel heavy and you blink a few times, trying to retain some clarity of thought.
(set: $sanity to it - 5)
$E[&#39;Tsk, what is it, girl? Speak!&#39;]

$E[&#39;Ah. So you **have** managed to spot it. Tsk tsk. What a nosy girl you are. very well then.&#39;]

Elise waves with her long, thin arm and suddenly the pressure in your head decreases, as if a veil is partially lifted from your eyes. Your vision becomes clearer and as your eyes finally manage to focus on the object in the corner, you see that it is a giant human-sized cocoon. 

$E[&#39;Surprised, dear? You shouldn&#39;t be. After all, it was you who warned me about her. Tsk tsk. Would you like to come and have a closer look?&#39;]

There are four of them, with the leader at the head of the part. He walks up to a few feet from you, stopping to eye you up and down. He is carrying a backpack from which several wires hang out, connecting to a strange metal device around his arm. His companions are brandishing swords, already drawn and ready. The men grinn at you with cold and bloodthirsty eyes.

$rando[&#39;Well, well, well. What an interesting pair we&#39;ve got here.&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Get avay!&#39;]

Ionut swings the shovel at the leader, but he dodges swiftly to the side, punching the servant in the chest with his metal contraption. A burst of sparks follows the impact and Ionut&#39;s body begins to violently shake, a distorted cry coming out of his mouth. Then the servant collapses on the ground, the smell of burnt flesh filling the air.

With a confident swagger, the men step forward, surrounding you. There is nowhere left to go. You manage to dodge the first two swings, but a third one catches you from behind. You stare at the blade sticking out of your chest, a stream of blood soaking your $suit.

You sit down on a bench, deciding to wait and see how things will go. It doesn&#39;t look like you have anything much to do. He lights a cigar and takes a log puff, then passes it to you. You take one as well, blowing the smoke towards the flame of the torches.

About an hour passes, when suddenly you hear approaching footsteps and  a group of men storm down the stairs, spreading into the basement.

$Io[&#39;Who are you?&#39;] shouts the servant, leaping to his feet, shovel ready in his hand.

You fall down with a muffled shriek. As the world begins to dim, you see the men heading down the basement.

Your feet take you forward, one hesitant step after the other, until you stand right in front of the cocoon. Your heart is pounding fast, drops of cold sweat soaking into your garments.

Elise plunges a finger at the top of the cocoon and runs it all the way down, slicing the strings of web along the way. Felicia&#39;s body slides down at your feet, naked and covered in bits of silk.

You stand frozen, unable to move, unwilling to process the situation.

With shaking hands, you take Felicia&#39;s body and lift it up. She feels still warm and soft. As her head leans on your shoulder, you can feel a faint breath caressing your cheek. 

$A[She&#39;s alive!]

A wave of relief washes over you, finally breaking your paralysis. $A[She&#39;s not dead, I didn&#39;t kill her!&#39;] (if: $Felicia_choice is &quot;friend&quot;)[Over the course of your journey, Felicia became one of the few people you could genuinely call a &quot;friend&quot;.

A wave of anxiety washes over you and you take a few steps back, inching towards the door.

$E[&#39;What&#39;s the matter, dear? Afraid to look?&#39;]

In an instant, Elise is behind you, her hand over your shoulder. Slowly but relentlessly she pushes you back forward, forcing you to move towards the cocoon.

You carry Felicia to the bed, letting her down to sink into the silky whiteness of the sheets. She gives a little moan, her closed eyelids trembling gently as if she&#39;s having a nightmare.

$E[&#39;Pretty catch, isn&#39;t she?&#39;]

Elise climbs on to the bed as well, lying on the other side of Felicia. Your vision shifts again and patches of an alternate view creep through the corner of your eye - long, thin legs dangling around, 6 green eyes staring at you with amused cruelty.

$E[&#39;Do you think that she wanted to be a motherrr? Let&#39;s find out.&#39;]

Elise pull&#39;s Felicia&#39;s hips closer, positioning her own big, round body exactly behind. Then she leans forward...

You can see the precise moment when something slips inside the cat. A shiver runs down her body and her face contracts in a scowl. She is still unconscious but you can feel the tension, as if part of her is aware of what&#39;s going on.

$A[Holy hell...]

As you keep watching, you see Felicia&#39;s body begin to tense up. She groans with pain, then suddenly relaxes, a soft moan escpaing her lips. In her belly, you can see a small bump that has just appeared under the skin.

The cat woman mumbles something, lost in her nightmare.

You take Felicia&#39;s hand and gently squeeze it, caressing her hair at the same time. Her breathing calms down a little and her expression relaxes. 

$a[&#39;There, there, it&#39;s all going to be alright..&#39;] you whisper in hear ear.

She leans forward and nuzzles her face in your chest, as if looking for a safe place. You can feel tension begin to build again, followed by another relaxation and moan as a new egg slides inside of her.

$A[Why-why am I doing this to her...?!]

A flash of guilt cuts through your mind like a hot iron, but it&#39;s too late to do anything about it now. What&#39;s done is done.

Felicia lifts her head up and lazily opens her eyes,smiling at you. It&#39;s clear that she is very much out of it and struggling to focus.

$M[&#39;Ah, my favorite human...&#39;]

Her hands meekly wrap around you in a hug and your guilt melts away, replaced by the warmth of her body. Your hands find their way onto her naked curves, exploring freely for the first time every inch of her.

You are overwhelmed by a sudden desire to be naked, to have your skin touch her skin. A small voice in your head is warning you that this can be a dangerous path to take, but the temptation is strong.

Leaning in, you grab Felicia&#39;s face with both hands and kiss her. Her lips have a rich sweetness with a hint of something bitter, like dark chocolate. Even in her unconscious state, she kisses you back and you sink into each other&#39;s embrace.

Your hand moves down from her face to her soft breasts. They are firm but full, somehow exactly as you had imagined them.

You can&#39;t take it any more. The desire is too strong, the moment - too perfect. You quickly slip out of your $suit, throwing it on the floor.

Finally, after all this time, your naked body presses against hers. You realize that you have always been waiting for this moment. Your $breasts against her soft breasts, your $hips rubbing against her small ones.

$A[Damn, I can&#39;t get enough of this!!]

You slide a hand down, feeling her chest, then her tummy. There are several bumps there now, growing with each egg that the spider pushes inside of her. 

Felicia presses firmly against you, as if to let you feel them even better. As her belly expands and her moans grow louder, you begin to feel a hint of jealousy, wanting to partake in the pleasure.

$A[No, I must resist...]

As the thought comes, the cat woman spreads her legs apart, allowing you to see the the thick tube plunged inside of her. Your gaze is instantly pinned to the view, completely mesmerized. You can see the line of round bulges inside the tube, lined up and ready, slowly moving forward... Worse still, you can see her $A[pleasure], you can feel it with each one slipping inside.

You let your fingers run down her bulging tummy and between her thighs, halting just short of the dark tube thrusting in and out of her. You creep forward cautiously, just at the edge of her folds, looking for the right spot.

As soon as you find it her body tenses up, shaken by a tremor of pleasure.

$M[&#39;Yes, yes!&#39;]

She grabs you and kisses you passionately, streams of saliva dripping down between your breasts and her breasts. Your fingers accelerate, moving up and down with the rhythm of the eggs being pushed inside of her. As she gazes at you, wide eyed and drooling, you know with certainty that she&#39;s too far gone to be brought back. $A[But now&#39;s not the time to think about that...]

Felicia&#39;s body begins to shake and with a last few caresses of her flower you push her over the edge. Her eyes roll up as she shakes into an intense orgasm, holding you close against her. Her skin is burning hot and her hair is all around you, mixed with drops of sweat and drool.

The tube retracts from her folds and the cat woman rolls on her back, pulling you on top of her. You stare into her blissful expression, your $breasts weighing down against hers. You can feel the big bulge of her tummy right underneath you, and a strange sense of pride from it.

It feels natural, even inevitable. With those soft lips waiting for yours, the action is no longer a choice of reason but an imperative of your primal desires. 

Your own body is aching for attention, jealous of the filled up cat woman and the purity of her pleasure. As you continue making out with her, her hands reach around and spread your legs apart, your ass alerady propped up on her round belly.

You don&#39;t even resist as the tube slides inside of you, pushing deep to the entrance of your womb. You realize now that you were expecting it, it was the natural, inevitable conclusion of everything.

The egg presses against your folds and you stretch to acommodate it, feeling it slide all the way inside, nesting into your womb. You continue kissing Felicia as your own belly begins to grow and stretch on top of hers. Every bulge pushes you deeper into the realm of unfathomable, indescribably pleasure and insanity. Time loses its meaning and your bodies intertwine, naked and vulnerable. Eventually, all that remains in your mind is you, her, and [[the madness-&gt;the maddness]].

Sitting at the feet of your mistress, you are truly content. It is a happiness that fills every fiber of your being, an all-encompasing sensation that pushes away any doubt that anything else could ever be felt.

Your mistress lays a hand on your head, filling you with joy. You must have been very good to deserve this affection. You turn around and give her a lust-filled look. 

Your round belly feels very heavy, but this only makes you happy. You don&#39;t know why exactly, but it is the best thing you could have ever wished for. It is what your mistress wants for you, and that is all that matters.

The other girl is happy too, you can see it in her eyes. Her belly is even rounder than yours - you can sense that she is getting close. You lean in and kiss her, and she kisses you back.

Elise waves with her long, thin arm and suddenly the pressure in your head decreases, as if a veil is partially lifted from your eyes. Your vision becomes clearer and as your eyes finally manage to focus on the object in the corner, you see that it is a giant human-sized cocoon.

Looking beyond the gate you can see vast cemetery grounds, stretching into the distance. 

The ground on the other side looks rough and barren, with nothing but dry, skeletal trees that extend their long-dead branches towards each other like the fingers of long-dead lovers. Between them you can see numerous grey tombstones, as well as broken statues, covered in lichen.

$A[Woah, this place must be really old... I wonder if those are all people from the local village? Seems too big to be just a family cemetery.]

What really draws your eyes however is a hill in the distance, rising above the field of graves. There is a small building on top of it, perhaps a chapel, or a tomb.

The small path seems to be winding towards it, but the gate is blocking your way. Perhaps you can ask Mihai for a key later, should you be inclined to take a stroll here, and should he be inclined to allow it.

[Approaching the old tree, you are suddenly attentive to the light breeze blowing through its dead branches. They seem to be moving, sometimes with, sometimes against it... or is it just your imagination?

$A[Dammit Alex, you&#39;ve seen *real* monsters already - now scared of a tree?]

Pushing past your irrational fears, you sit down next to the tree, leaning your back at the old, dried out bark. It is actually surprisingly comfortable.

You take a moment to stare at the sky - it&#39;s grey-blue, with a handful of clouds sliced by the sharp mountain peaks far above. It&#39;s actually a very pleasant view.

As you continue to relax and look at the sky, from the corner of your eye you see a hand extending over your left shoulder, its fist tightly clenched in a fist. Your breathing slows down and the seconds stretch into infinity. It&#39;s as if your spine is glued to the tree, all of your muscles completely unresponsive.

Suddenly the hand opens, letting something fall down to the ground. You can see pale skin, long fingernails, and a black tattoo of a circle with arrows just below the wrist.

Then you blink, and the hand is gone.

$a[&#39;Yes, Mistress...&#39;]

$S[&#39;Excellent! Now wait for a moment.&#39;]

Sabrina heads somewhere behind you, probably to the end of the room, as you can hear her opening the large trunk and moving things inside of it. 

You do your best to keep your eyes on the rune on the wall, despite your curiosity to turn around and see what she&#39;s doing. The strange symbol seems to to glow dimly, but it could be just your eyes getting tired.

After a while, Sabrina returns, standing right behind you. Although you can&#39;t see her, you feel her fingers running down your spine, making the hairs of your skin sand on edge.

$S[&#39;Now, sis... I want you to relax.&#39;]

Suddenly you feel a weight on your shoulder and a hundred pointy needles crawling across your skin.

$a[&#39;Wh-what is THAT?!&#39;]

$S[&#39;Just stay clam, you are safe.&#39;]

The thing moves to your back and up to the other shoulder, sending chills down your spine. It feels almost like a giant centipede is crawling on your skin, but you can also fel something cold and slimy...

Gripped by terror, you feel the creature peak its head over your shoulder. You are frozen in fear, your heart racing a million miles an hour. Sabrina told you to keep your eyes on the rune at all times, but you just **have to** know..

Ever so slowly, you turn your head to the left, coming face to face with the monstrocity on your shoulder.

It is one of the moust hideous things you&#39;ve ever seen. A bizarre mix between an arthropode and a mollusc, the creature has a face like a shrimp, with lots of thin apendages sticking around it. It&#39;s body is covered in a partial shell from the bottom, where lots of skeletal legs move it around. But on the top side you can see an area of exposed, slug-like, glistening skin, from which a handful of fleshy antennas with bulbous ends are dangling.

Frozen in shock and fear, you can&#39;t even open your mouth to scream.

$S[&#39;Bad girl!&#39;]

Sabrina slaps you across the face, snapping you out of the stupor. You blink fast and the creature is gone, retracting down your back.

$S[&#39;I told you not to look!&#39;] Now standing in front of you, Sabrina has a cross look on her face.

$a[&#39;I&#39;m sorry, but- this thing! It&#39;s hideous, get it off me!!&#39;]

$S[&#39;Calm down, it won&#39;t hurt you. In fact, they are quire gentle.&#39;]

$a[&#39;They?!&#39;]

$S[&#39;Indeed. But let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves. One is enough for you for now&#39;]

The creature moves across your back, darting left and right as if to explore the new territory. Eventually it crawls down to your butt, it&#39;s head pushing between your legs.

Trying to follow Sabrina&#39;s instructions, you keep your eyes firmly on the rune, despite the overwhelming temptation to have a peek.

The creature moves back, crawling up and down your back, exploring.

$S[&#39;What do you feel?&#39;]

You try to concentrate. Lots of legs, thin and pointy. $a[&#39;An arthropode...?&#39;] But there&#39;s something more. Every now and then you feel a cold touch, something slimy. You imagine a curious snail feeling its environment with its antennae. $A[&#39;I also feel something soft... like a mollusc...&#39;]

$S[&#39;Excellent!&#39;] beams Sabrina, patting you on the head. $S[&#39;It&#39;s a hybrid.&#39;] She pauses. $S[&#39;One thing you must learn is not to always go with your eyes. Something might *look* repulsive... and yet bring the greatest of pleasures. Observe.]

With a mix of reluctance and excitement, you move your legs ever so slightly apart, allowing the creature to explore a little further.

Encouraged by the invitation, the creature moves forward, its curious tendrils exploring the curves of your body.

$S[&#39;Very, good, sis,&#39;] says Sabrina encouragingly, patting you on the head. $S[&#39;Curiosity is a good thing. Follow your desires, do not suppress them.&#39;]

$a[&#39;It&#39;s scary....&#39;]

The vampire comes in front of you, trasing a finger on you as she goes. $S[&#39;There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of. Give in to it.&#39;] She leans in and  kisses onto you, her black lipstick smearing over your $lips.

Her breasts press against your own $breasts, the piercings of her nipples rubbing against your own. Your head is spinning and you give into her seduction. You close your eyes and feel black and violet, her taste in your mouth, the gentle caress on your belly.

Her hand continues sliding down between your legs, the tip of her fingers starting to explore the entrance of your folds.

$a[&#39;Ooh~&#39;]

A warm wave of pleasure washes over you and you relax a little more, surrendering to her motions. The embers of desire begin to glow hot in your tummy and before long you find yourself eagerly pushing back against her and twisting your pelvis back and forth with the vampire&#39;s teasing strokes.

She breaks the kiss, pulling back a few inches to stare at your lustful expression.

$S[&#39;I hope this helped to ease your worries a little. Now, are you ready to continue?&#39;]

$S[&#39;Now, now, sis... need I remind you that you&#39;re the one who wanted this? Play nice.&#39;]

Sabrina comes in front of you, trasing a finger on you as she goes. With your arms tied in the air, there&#39;s nothing you can do to prevent her leaning in and forcing a deep kiss onto you, her black lipstick smearing over your $lips.

You give Sabrina another small nod and she retracts her hand, freeing the space for the creature to continue its exploration.

The crawling abomination slips further down, the antennae on its head curiously investigating the outer edges of your folds. 

Its presence creates a strange mixture of dread and excitement as you feel the numerous appendages crawling on your skin. You wonder about the things it could do to you, threats and promises of unspeakable sensations from slimy, other-worldly caresses.

The creature moves forward again, now its entire body hanging underneath in the space between your legs, from back to front. The last legs and its tail are hanging just at your lower back, and its head is starting to poke out under your tummy.

$S[&#39;Don&#39;t look down, now! Just keep your eyes straight ahead... good!&#39;]

You follow Sabrina&#39;s instructions, trying to keep your composure. You can feel the creature&#39;s advances slowly becoming bolder as its various... *tools* become acquianted with your anatomy.

$a[&#39;Aaah!&#39;]

Something presses against you, looking for an entrance. It feels cold and slimy, twisting and turning against your skin. The entire creature tightens its grip, pressing its body against you.

With every step the $in[eerie feeling] is getting stronger and more concrete. You follow it through the graveyard, making your way further to the deep end. It feels almost like being lead on a leash, the mysterious force pulling you along to where it wants to.

The wave of pleasure is immediate and intense. As it wiggles its way deeper, its body also presses more firmly against you.

$Ru[&#39;I did not call you here. But I see that you&#39;ve found my necklace - it must have brought you here.&#39;]

$a[&#39;I see... well, in any case, I&#39;m here. Hello.... I guess..?&#39;]

You extend a hand forward, before realizing that the woman couldn&#39;t possibly shake it. She looks at you, unamused.

Using an old rusty shovel you spot in the nearby bushes, you start digging the soil and piling it on a little black heap to the side. 

After half an hour of hard work, the hole is finally starting to reach a depth of a few feet. You feel like you&#39;re almost there...

At last, you start hitting something other than soil and the outlines of a skeleton slowly emerge under your excavating efforts.

$A[How did I end up digging up bones...]

While you haven&#39;t removed all of the soil, you can already see that there is more than just bones in there. With a resounding *clang!*, your shovel hits something metal. The skeleton has been wrapped up in chains from head to toe.

$Ru[&#39;Don&#39;t ask, just do it!&#39;] She waves her scepter at you, growing impatient.

You find yourself instinctively obeying her before having the time to really think it through. You lift the necklace up and bring the piece of bone to it, pressing against the wooden surface. The dark runes begin to pulse and wiggle as the wood opens up and swallows the bone inside of it.

You feel a strange light-headedness and a sense of distance from the world around you.

$Ru[&#39;Now, remember these words: $unav2[n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂Ꮈຖ໓s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ŝᶠֆʄʝǟf̴̨̤̣͍̳̣̆̒͜千n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂ᎸŜᶠֆʄʝǟf̴̨̤̣͍̳̣̆̒͜s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ꮈຖ໓n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂千h҉s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ŝᶠֆժʂƒʝąղƒd̶s̶f̶j̶a̶♐︎🙰]&#39;] The ghost speaks in a mysterious, other-worldly language.

It isn&#39;t voluntary, but there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. The stimulation pushes you overboard and your body shakes in a climax, your restrained members trembling from the pleasure.

At the peak of your orgasm, you feel something press into your ear and slither its way forward, deeper and deeper.

$Ru[&#39;Well at least you did what you&#39;re good at, little whore. Thank you for the invitation.&#39;]

It pushes deeper in, defying any expectations of your anatomy. The crawling thing wiggles relentlessly like a fat, giant worm, burrowing into your head. You begin to feel it digging into your brain, a terrifying yet oddly arousing sensation.

As it penetrates deeper still, your eyes begin to roll back and you start climaxing, over and over again.

$Ru[&#39;What a stupid girl you are. I will be taking that brain now - you weren&#39;t using it anyway.&#39;]

Your ear stretches, accomodating its unlikely visitor deeper into your head. You feel your thoughts and consciousness being erased little by little, engulfed in awarm, fuzzy haze. Between your legs there&#39;s a burning desire, unctrollable and all engulfing. Your juices flow like a torrent as pure pleasure washes over you like a tsunami.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/evil_tree2.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
You cum over and over again as the branches engulf your brain, sprouting to the deepest corners of your consciousness.

Your hips grind shamelessly against the living veins, riding wave after wave of pleasure as your mind is slowly being erased.

You feel another presence coming in, a visitor walking into a new home. But there isn&#39;t enough space for both of you.

You are being pushed out, out and away, into the velvet haze, into oblivion and nothingness. There are no memories there, no thoughts, only pleasure.

You climax again, one last time.

After a long moment, a lone tree in the garden lets down a naked woman, who hesitantly makes her first steps in centuries.

$Ru[&#39;Not perfect... but I can work with this.&#39;]

Ruxandra heads into the forest, disappearing from sight. Your mind lingers for a few more moments into the tree&#39;s hollow shell, then (link-reveal-goto: &quot;fades away.&quot;,&quot;DIESUCCUBUS&quot;)[

The ghost seems pensive for a while.

$Ru[&#39;Monsters, creatures like you, they have innate magical abilities. To them it is natural that they have powers - and that **we** don&#39;t.&#39;]

$a[&#39;We?&#39;]

$Ru[&#39;Humans. They think we are good for nothing, can never use magic and even if we did, we wouldn&#39;t be any good at it. But I learned magic - better than any of them! And so they feared me. That is why I was killed and placed here, in a nameless grave - so that their shame can be forever forgotten!&#39;]

You slowly rise to your feet.

The ghost is gone, the forest is quiet. The necklace around your neck seems back to its regular form, albeit a tiny bit heavier.

The only reminder that this wasn&#39;t all a vivid dream is the freshly dug grave.

$Ru[&#39;You have won... here, take it! Just spare me...&#39;]

With a terrible shriek, the tree splits itself in half, exposing a dark, pulsating core. Right in the middle, you can see the rune necklace, waiting for you.

The runes flare up and the clouds darken above, condensing into a sphere of black thunder. Lightning strikes the old tree, splitting it into half.

The old tree stands splintered in half, with no sign of the runes or any other supernatural activity. Its dead branches no longer twist without breeze, instead laying completely motionless.

$A[A sad end...]

As you examine the aftermath of the lightning, you notice something poking from the charred wound. $A[The necklace!]

The peculiar trinket is lying in the center of the tree, right where the lightning split it in half. Oddly enough, it doesn&#39;t seem to have been damaged in the process.

You pick up the necklace and look it over. Just like before, it seems to have a reassuring aura. $A[It must have been some amulet of protection... perhaps why the spirit needed it so badly.]

In any case, it&#39;s no use to her now. Perhaps it will serve you better.

You grab the necklace from the charred tree and put it on. It feels like a hard-earned war trophy and you&#39;re more than a little proud of how you handled the situation.

$A[No spirit is going to mess with me...!]

As you stroll back to the Crooked Elm, you take one last glance at the old tree. Its crooked silhouette is barely distinguishable among the other dead things in the garden. $A[I wonder if someone will even notice...]

You undress and get down in front of her, bowing your head down. A black hand gives you a pat and then you feel a rope pressing against your body.

With quick and precise movements, Elise moves around you, tieing you up with hands behind your back, the white threads contouring your $breasts for her.

$E[&#39;Such a pretty thing you are, tsk!&#39;]

You blush but remain silent, sinking further into the weird state of letting the creature do whatever it wants with you.

She goes to a drawer and comes towards you, carrying something.

$E[&#39;These will be for your tits, girl. To remind you of me. Tsk, tsk.&#39;]

You allow yourself to look up a little. You can see that she is holding two large metal spiders which appear quite heavy. You swallow hard.

You approach the old tree, threading carefully and casually. The necklace rests comfortably on your chest, the dark runes rubbing against your smooth skin.

You are not sure how much the woman will remember, but you try to give yourself a naive, innocent look.

$A[Just your friendly neighborhood succubus dropping by...]

As you step closer, you sense a tension fill the air. There&#39;s a pull around your neck and the necklace almost lifts up a little, drawn to the tree. A familiar haze hits your mind, stronger and more aggressive than before.

$Ru[*&#39;You! Who are you... How do you have my necklace?&#39;*]

The voice of the ghost has a note of genuine surprise, almost worry. You give yourself a silent smirk. Time to choose your approach.

$Ru[&#39;....&#39;]

$Ru[&#39;Yes, I&#39;m a fairy. Now be a good girl and return my necklace.&#39;]

There&#39;sno point in resisting. The branch plunges into your ear and you give in to the stimulation. The sensation pushes you overboard and your body shakes in a climax, your restrained members trembling from the pleasure.

At the peak of your orgasm, the root slithers its way forward, deeper and deeper.

$Ru[&#39;How easy this was, little whore!&#39;]

It pushes deeper in, defying any expectations of your anatomy. The crawling thing wiggles relentlessly like a fat, giant worm, burrowing into your head. You begin to feel it digging into your brain, a terrifying yet oddly arousing sensation.

As it penetrates deeper still, your eyes begin to roll back and you start climaxing, over and over again.

Your ear stretches, accomodating its unlikely visitor deeper into your head. You feel your thoughts and consciousness being erased little by little, engulfed in awarm, fuzzy haze.

She looks old, though you can&#39;t quite put a number on her age. There&#39;s an odd glint in her eyes,  buried into her pale, wrinkled skin. She&#39;s wearing a simple linen tunic, though her hair is adorned with feathers and odd bits which you can&#39;t quite identify.

$a[&#39;I just arrived here recently, for a summer job,&#39;] you say jovially, giving the old woman a nervous smile. $a[&#39;And I&#39;m not a child, I&#39;m working to pay my studies!]

You follow the old woman out of the inn and to the village center. Ever so slowly she makes her way past the houses of the main street and towards the outskirts, limping on her cane as she goes.

The two of you walk in silence, reaching the end of the village and the familiar $in[hunting cabin]. You can see a small trail continuing beyond, into the old pine forest.

$Y[&#39;It&#39;s not very far dear, just o&#39;er the hill there,&#39;] she says, pointing her cane down the trail. You nod and continue walking after her, leaving the hunting cabin behind.

The path winds between the old pine trees, barely distinguishable from the rest of the forest. After a few more minutes of walking, it comes out at a clearing, where you see a small wooden house. There&#39;s a fence around a modest garden, where a handful of chickens are pecking at the dirt. You can also see an old barn and a few stacks of hay left to dry in the sun.

The house of the old woman seems like a relic from the olden times, much like many other things from the village. The old wooden pillars, the crooked pans, the handmade furniture with rough, uneven edges - everything feels like stepping into another century, an era of waking with the sun and sleeping by the fire.

On the walls of the hut, you can see a collection of jars with grain and herbs, and other things too, that you can&#39;t quite make out through the dust and cobwebs.

$Y[&#39;Would you like a cup of tea, dear?&#39;]

Not waiting for your answer, the old woman puts a kettle on the stove, throwing in a pinch of this and that from various jars. A peculiar smell fills the room as you wait for the water to boil.

When the brew&#39;s done the gran pours you a cup, sliding it in front of you. The hot steam rises up, tempting your nostrils with its strange aroma.

The gran sits on the opposite end of the table, resting her head on the wall. She seems oddly tired all of a sudden. It seems like you have a moment until the tea is cooling down.

You nod at her and lift the cup to your lips, taking a small sip. The taste is bitter but oddly pleasant. The kindly old woman smiles at you and you take another sip. She seems pleased.

You finish the cup in a minute and rise to your feet. Your body feels warmer and somehow heavier.

The quirky old woman leads you outside and through the small yard where her chickens are still pecking at the dirt. As you walk, you are beginning to feel an odd *lightheadedness* and a sense of disorientation. 

$A[Something... doesn&#39;t feel quite... right...]

You stumble to the side, the world starting to spin. Your body feels hot and somehow **heavy**, heavier than it&#39;s ever been. You pant heavily, starting to sweat.

$A[Can&#39;t... breathe...]

The grass feels cool and soft under your palms. It&#39;s so green, so fresh, so *juicy*. You are walking down on all fours through the yard. Why are you here? Where are you going?

Your body continues to grow hot and you feel a tingling sensation on the top of your head as two small horns begin to pop up. You shake your head in confusion, growing frightened.

$Y[&#39;There, there, it&#39;s okay girl. Nothing to worry about.&#39;]

A caring hand guides you forward into the barn, leading you towards a wooden stand. With every step you feel your hips become thicker and larger. The base of your spine extends from your back as a short, fluffy tail begins to dangle between your legs.

You don&#39;t know what to do. Your mind swimming into a $A[haze], the only option left is to $A[follow and obey].

You let yourself be lead to the wooden stand, where you lean on top of a beam. It feels good to be relieved of the growing $A[weight] of your body.

Just as you try to relax, a hand grabs one of your swollen breasts and forcefully pulls on it, squeezing a stream of milk into a bucket below.

The woman continues to mutter to herself as her fingers work, squeezing stream after stream from your tits down into the bucket. The pace of her motions is rhythmic and somehow soothing. The rough, wrinkled skin of her bony fingers is like a perfect fit for the soft tenderness of your breasts.

The sensation is not pleasant, but you feel compelled to stay and endure it. After all, what else could you do?

You run a hand on the rough surface of the table. It looks crude, but durable. Must have lasted over a century.

$a[&#39;Mihai seems to think that a bit of modernity will do the village good. Move with the times, that sort of thing.&#39;]

The gran frowns at that. $Y[&#39;Ah, Mihai. That boy still has the temper of youth about him. He&#39;ll come to his senses once his father pulls him by the collar.&#39;]

There is a strange relief in the process, a deep-rooted need being fulfilled. It&#39;s natural, irresitable, *inevitable*.

As your breasts swell with milk to the brim, ready to burst, so must someone do the milking, squeeze them hard and relieve you of this growing burden. 

Every repetition of the motion solidifies your complacency. How could you ever think to run away or protest? You $A[need] this. In many ways, the old woman is taking $A[care] of you by doing you this service. 

You bow your head and stifle your whimpers.

$Y[&#39;Such a wonderful thing, the spirit of youth...&#39;]

With the corner of your eye you see the old woman grab a wooden cup and dip it into the bucket, then bring it to her lips. She tilts her head back, swallowing the entire cup in a few mighty gulps. When she looks at you again, her face is completely different - younger and stronger, with an iron smile and piercing gaze.

$Y[&#39;Thank you, dear. This is exactly what I needed.&#39;]

As her hands resume her work, you are starting to feel a growing tiredness. You can barely keep your eyes open, your body collapsing on the wooden beam underneath you.

$Y[&#39;There, there, everything will be alright, dear,&#39;] says a reassuring voice, though it seems to be very far now. Your mind is sleeping farther and farther into the welcoming darkness.

You awaken by the pecking of a hen on your shoulder. You are lying naked on the ground, a handfull of half-chewed blades of grass in your mouth.

You spring to your feet. (if: $hour&lt;18)[The mountain sun peers through the tops of the pines, it&#39;s position different than you remember.](else:)[The sun is already hidden behidn the mountain tops. It&#39;s getting late.]

You spot your $suit, lying casually in the garden, not far from you. The old woman is nowhere to be seen, though you can hear noises coming from the inside the house.

You reach towards your clothes, but stumble back with a loud clang. There is a rope around your neck, decorated with a little cowbell.

Suddenly the noises from the kitchen stop and you hear footsteps heading your way.

You dash forward, grabbing your $suit and then running towards the end of the garden. Still naked, you sprint around the chickens and jump over the small wooden fence. Just as you hear the creak of the door opening, you manage to slip between the first pine trees, hiding yourself from view. You carry on running for a while, until finally, you stop.

You are alone in the forest. You take a moment to catch your breath, leaning on a tree. It seems that you are safe.

$A[Phew... did not expect THAT to happen...]

Gathering back your clarity of mind, you get dressed again and start walking in the general direction of the village. After several minutes you begin to recognize the landscape and see the familiar outline of the $in[hunting cabin]. $A[Made it back!]

You almost spit your drink out, face going red. $A[How does she know?!] Fighting a wave of rising panic, you begin to shift in your seat uncomfortably, contemplating an escape.

$Y[&#39;Oh, come on now, dear, no need for theatrics. It was an honest catch, but it seems like you have some tricks up your sleeve as well. We could call it even.&#39;] She takes another sip, keeping her beady eyes on you.

You raise your glass to her and take a few hefty gulps of your drink. You&#39;ve barely had the time to put it down when you feel a familiar heat spreading through your body. The room begins to sway in front of your eyes. You grab the table, trying to steady yourself.

$Y[&#39;I&#39;ve told you, darling. Everything is a game.&#39;]

As the heat in your body increases, you feel your breasts beginning to swell. They fill out your clothes and begin to stretch them out, pushing to the limit. You are starting to fear that your $suit is going to burst and your enlarged bosom will spill out in front of you, taking on a life of its own.

$a[&#39;What- do you want- ?&#39;] you ask, panting heavily.

$Y[&#39;Why, just to relieve you of this burden, dear. I see that you are somewhat *resiliant*, so I decided to not be greedy.

You shift in your seat. Something in her voice tells you that she isn&#39;t lying. Your breasts feel bigger and heavier than ever, aching to be relieved. Your head is still spinning, but you&#39;ll be damned if you let the old hag have the best of you a second time.

The gran smirks at you and gets up, beckoning you with a finger to follow. 

As the two of you cross the inn, you feel a handful of inquisitve stares fall on you. You blush and lower your eyes to the floor, hoping to conceal your embarrassment. You may not have the cow bell anymore, but the old woman still herds you around in much the same way.

She leads you to the other end of the room, and opens a small door to a storage room, inviting you in.

$Y[&#39;You made the right choice, dearie. Nothing wrong with accepting the occasional defeat. Now come on here.&#39;]

She takes an old metal bucket from a shelf and places it at her feet, sitting on a small box for support. You hesitate for a moment. $A[Thank god no one can see this...]

You pull your top up, struggling to get it off over your swollen breasts. When you finally manage to succeed, they hang down even further, pulling you with their enormous weight. 

$A[What the hell did I get myself into...]

But it&#39;s too late to back off now. Swallowing the last of your pride, you kneel over the bucket.

$Y[&#39;That&#39;s a good girl,&#39;] praises you the old woman, giving you a pat on the head. Then she grabs one of your breasts and squeezes it downwards, forcing a stream of milk into the bucket.

Lavius completely shreds your $suit to pieces. Your naked body glistens in the darkness, beads of sweat covering your skin. The vampire runs his hands along it, feeling every curve. Reaching your arms, he places them in an outstretched position above your head and you soon feel the soft touch of leather wrapping around your wrists.

You let him tie you up. After all, resistance is futile. You feel completely defenceless and exposed, your flower twitching as he stares hungrily at it. $A[Maybe this is exactly what I wanted...]

He bends down and kisses it, leaving a trail of saliva along your slit. You are ready.

A shiver runs through your body.
Finally he comes, sliding inside your dripping cunt with ease. A moan escapes your throat.

Getting on top of you, his teeth sink into the side of your neck, puncturing your artery. Then you feel him penetrate you, starting to pump a rhythm as the blood is drained out of your body.

Your head spins. There is no pain.

The thrusts continue, filling your aching pussy over and over again.

Your body twitches as you feel yourself grow weaker.

He fucks you harder and faster. indiscernible screams escape your mouth.

You try to stay as steady as you can as the old woman&#39;s deft hands do their work, squeezing stream after stream from your swollen tits into the bucket.

As she carries on her work you feel a strange peace and lightheadedness and a strange acceptance of your condition. You are growing more docile and passive.

Ever so slowly your body is relieved from the burden and your breasts begin to return to their previous shape and size. There is a strange satisfaction in the process, almost a gratification for a job well done. By the time it&#39;s completely over, you feel almost regretful that it didn&#39;t last a little longer.

Lavius pulls you back up, steadying you with a hand on each hip. It&#39;s clear that he&#39;s amused by the situation.

$a[&#39;I- I- think I can manage-&#39;]

$L[&#39;Are you sure? You seem quite tipsy. Perhaps you&#39;d like to rest a bit at my place?&#39;]

His hands move up gently, now resting just under your massive breast. You find yourself almost hoping for him to move them even further up so that you can have some of the weight taken off of your shoulders.

You make a tentative step forward, but almost fall again, before Lavius manages to steady you. It&#39;s clear that you won&#39;t be going far in this condition. What&#39;s worse still, you can tell that *everyone* is starting to watch you.

You let yourself collapse on the floor under the table. Everyone is watching, but you don&#39;t care anymore. It&#39;s actually quite nice to be down here. The world is spinning less and your breasts don&#39;t weigh as much. Lavius was right - it is comfortable.

Lavius sits on the bench in front of you. $L[&#39;Alright darling, you can start.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Wha..?&#39;]

You look around, disoriented.

Lavius reaches down with a hand and grabs you by the hair, pulling you closer. $L[&#39;I see that you are not in tip-top condition at the moment, but you should manage this much, I hope, yes?&#39;]

It&#39;s finally becoming clear what he wants. You sigh and lean in to his crotch. He gives you a little assistance and soon enough you have your lips wrapped around his cock, head bobbing up and down. His hand is guiding your pace and you surrender yourself to the situation.

After several minutes of this, you feel him tense up and shoot a sticky load in your mouth, which you eagerly gulp down. $A[At least it&#39;s a free charge...]

Lavius takes a moment to get cleaned up using your tongue, then gets up.

As the two of you cross the inn, you feel the smirks and stares all focused on you. You whipe the cum from your chin and lower your eyes to the floor, hoping to conceal your embarrassment. You can deal with your reputation later, or at least what&#39;s left of it.

Lavius leads you to the other end of the room, and opens a small door to a storage room, inviting you in.

You follow his command and walk into the dimly lit space. He closes the door behind you, cutting away from the noise of the inn&#39;s patrons.

$Y[&#39;So, how are we going to do this, darling?&#39;]

You look around, confused. After some head scratching, Lavius takes an old metal bucket from a shelf and places it at his feet, sitting on a small box for support. You hesitate for a moment. $A[Thank god no one can see this...]

You pull your top up, struggling to get it off over your swollen breasts. When you finally manage to succeed, they hang down even further, pulling you with their enormous weight. 

$A[What the hell did I get myself into...]

But it&#39;s too late to back off now. Swallowing the last of your pride, you kneel over the bucket.

$L[&#39;You&#39;re doing great!&#39;] He grabs one of your breasts and squeezes it downwards, forcing a stream of milk into the bucket.

You try to stay as steady as you can as the charming vampire&#39;s slender hands do their work, squeezing stream after stream from your swollen tits into the bucket.

As he carries on his work you feel a little bit of your clarity returning with each squeeze. Ever so slowly your body is relieved from the burden and your breasts begin to return to their previous shape and size. You breathe a sigh of relief.

$L[&#39;I think we&#39;re just about done here,&#39;] nods Lavius, giving the full bucket a little tap. $L[&#39;Do you want this, or shall I leave it for cocktails at the bar?&#39;]

$a[&#39;You- I don&#39;t want it!&#39;]

He chuckles and pushes it to the side. $L[&#39;I&#39;m sure the barman will make a happy discovery. I think now you deserve a little privacy.&#39;]

He gives you a little wink and heads out, closing the door behind him.

You get up, slowly returning to your normal state of mind. Your $suit is nearby and you get dressed again. That was definitely a strange experience.

You wait for a minute to make sure that she&#39;s really gone, then you carefully approach. The water is dark and still. There is no sign of Narcissa.

You take a deep breath, trying to piece everything together. Lavius, the werewolf. Elise. The box in the basement.

The black slime is pulsating and crawling as though animated by a life of its own. It sticks to your legs and begins to crawl up, enveloping them in its cold embrace.

You lift your chin up and scour your surroundings. You are in an enormous subterranian space, littered with massive piles of stuff, some several meters tall. You appear to have fallen in the center of it, with the walls in the distance barely visible even with your new dark vision.

Just as you begin to feel a wave of hopelessness, you notice a small opening in one of the walls.

He passes you the cigar and you take a deep puff of it, blowing a little cloud of smoke into the night.

About an hour passes, when you suddenly see a group of shadowy figures emerge from the forest and head straight to your location. You both raise to your feet.

$Io[&#39;Who there?&#39;] shouts the servant, shovel ready in his hand.

The figures approach closer, with the leader at the head of the part. He walks up to a few feet from you, stopping to eye you up and down. Your heart is pounding. You look nervously at the sky, but everything seems normal.

For a brief moment, everything seems to be going according to plan. Then the fallen leader flicks something and punches the elder in the chest, shoves the metal device straight in his heart.

Sparks fly everywhere and a terrible screech pierces the night. After a long moment, the body of the Elder falls to the ground, charred and fuming.

With a confident swagger, the men step forward, surrounding you. There is nowhere left to go. You manage to dodge the first two swings, but a third one catches you from behind. You stare at the blade sticking out of your chest, a stream of blood soaking your $suit.

You fall down with a muffled shriek. As the world begins to dim, you see the men heading down the basement.

Despite his prowess and the ease with which he dealt with the previous opponents, the ancient vampire does not move with arrogance. You can sense his full alertness, the way his eyes pierce every inch of the hallway and his nostrils enlarge with every deep breath he takes.

He continues moving forward, then abruptly stops at one of the intersections. There is a tunnel to the side, though you can see only darkness.

In an instant, the Elder spreads his wings and dashes towards the ceiling, his hand extending to a corner veiled in shadows. He then comes crashing down, pinning a $E[dark figure] down to the ground.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pit_centipede.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

Your heart is pounding in your chest as the reality of the situation creeps upon you. Terror begins to rise but then the liquid warmth returns lulling you into a haze of lust and pleasure. By the time the second round object comes, your hole is already waiting for it and opens willingly, letting it slide inside.

$a[&#39;Aaaahh!&#39;] Lusty moans escape your lips with each new sphere pushed inside of your body. Your thoughts begin to recede and you no longer remember who you are or where you are. All that you know is the liquid warmth, the fullness of your body, and the pleasure of your hole stretching and closing again and again as the comfortable pressure inside you increases. 

A milion feathers are gently caressing your skin and you curl up, letting them envelop you in an almost motherly embrace. You can no longer open your eyes, nor do you wish to. Your mind dissolves into (link-reveal-goto:&quot;lust and darkness.&quot;,&quot;DIESUCCUBUS&quot;)[

$a[&#39;Fuck fuck fuck, not again....!!&#39;]

As terror grips you, you feel the familiar $in[deep and primal force] surge through your body. It begins in your belly and bursts up like a roaring flame. 

$a[&#39;Aaaaah!!&#39;] You scream off the top of your lungs as the darknes condenses rapidly around you, forming $a[**two giant wings**] on your back. You begin flapping them frantically, the speed of your fall slowing down with every massive swing. It is clumsy and imperfect and you have no clue what the hell you&#39;re doing, but somehow you regain a fraction of control.

After several more long seconds, you [[suddenly hit the ground-&gt;hit the ground2]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1483" name="hit the ground2" tags="deathpit" position="13284,1063" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt;

You drop into a pile of bones that cracks and splinters as you roll down the side of it violently. Your body hits a bump and for a moment you are sent flying into the air again, arms flailing, before you hit the surface again, splashing bits around you.

You are in the pit. Again.

$A[Alright, Alex, just clam down... perhaps it will be different this time.]

You tentatively get to your feet, wobbling slightly. The $in[stale smell of decay] is already hitting you. You need to hurry. The good thing is that your vision seems to have activated on its own this time. You can $in[see in the dark]. And you can see the door.

Squashing ancient remains of forgotten things, you begin to make your way towards the door. You feel empowered by your new abilities. You can do this.

Suddenly something pulls your leg. Your heart skips a beat and you feel a familiar sinking feeling in your belly. Moments flash before your eyes as you vividly remember (if: $deathlist contains &quot;slime pit&quot;)[a living puddle of darkness bubbling all around, pulling you deeper into the remains of previous unfortunate victims while it forces its way deep inside you](else:)[a million tiny legs wrap around your body, coddling you into nightmarish slumber as the creature pushes its brood inside you].

You take the familiar trail towards the village, navigating by the light of the full moon and the sound of the creek running by the road. The forest seems oddly peaceful.

$A[With all the monsters gathered at the manor, this might actually be the best time for a night walk...]

You continue walking for about a quarter of an hour, slowly descending towards the village. Just as you begin to wonder if this is really going to work, you spot a faint light coming among the trees on the other side of the creek. 

$A[That must be them!]

You feel your heartbeat increasing. (if: $deathlist contains &quot;torture&quot;)[The last time the men got their hands on you, you ended up nailed to a chair and electrocuted to death. A cold chill runs down your spine. But you know you have to do this.]

You cross the creek and dive among the trees, following the flicker of light. Soon enough a familiar mix of rugged voices reach your ears, confirming that you are on the right track.

Eventually the trees part, revealing a small clearing where a camp fire is blazing, surrounded by a few shadowy figures. The men are relaxed in a conversation, tossing a handful of dice on a board and smoking cigars. You can see a few bags thrown around, as well as their weapons leaning against a tree.

You continue approaching the camp and a few branches crack under your feet, suddenly alerting the men to your presence. They raise to their feet, reaching for their weapons.

$rando[&#39;Stay where you are!&#39;] The leader steps forward, eyeing you up and down. The rest of the men exchange glances.

You suddenly realize that they do not remember your previous encounters. To them, you are a strange woman with horns that has just stepped out of the darkness. $A[They are probably used to seeing lots of non-humans, but perhaps not succubi...]

A heavy silence hangs in the air. (if: $suit is &quot;housemaid outfit&quot; )[You twist the edge of your maid skirt, trying to give yourself a naive and innocent look.](elseif: $suit is &quot;butler&#39;s uniform&quot;)[You brush the collar of your butler uniform, giving yourself a sharp and professional look.](elseif: $suit is &quot;devil&#39;s gown&quot; )[Your devil&#39;s gown shifts, leaving deep cuts on the sides of your hips that draw the looks of the gang.] Nonetheless, the weapons remain pointed at you.

You lean on a tree, giving them a cheeky look

$rando[&#39;Don&#39;t test our patience, demon. Who are you and what are you doing here?&#39;]

The leader approaches you and you can see the metal device already mounted on his arm. $A[It&#39;s the thing that took out Ionut... I need to find a way to disable it!]

You try to study the device without making your intentions obvious, but you can&#39;t get a very clear view of it. The tension is rising in the air. You will need to diffuse the situation if you want any chance of not getting clubbed to death in the coming seconds.

$in[Time is ticking.]

You could try to ruse your way out of the situation and convince the men that you&#39;re here to help. Or you could see if your charms are enough to make them think with their dicks rather than their heads...

$a[&#39;Relax, fellas. It is Lavius that sent me here.&#39;] You wave a hand non-chalantly to lower their weapons, but are met with dubious looks.

$rando[&#39;Lavius? Why would he send you?&#39;]

You look the leader dead in the eye. He is a rough man and you can tell that he&#39;s used to smelling lies. However you have one big advantage he doesn&#39;t know about - you&#39;ve seen the future. You&#39;ve been there. This gives you a quiet confidence. $in[Your mind is clear. You are in control.]

$a[&#39;Why, to assist you with the plan, of course. Things have changed. We need to adapt.&#39;]

The man raises an eyebrow. $rando[&#39;**We?** he never mentioned you, doll.&#39;]

You move forward and inch towards the man&#39;s face. Close and personal. You can smell his sweat, see the unshaven patches on his beard. Your horns are almost poking at his skin. Your $lips blossom in an arrogant smile. $a[&#39;Do you think you are his only trump card, little man? And that he tells you everything, always? That he would have no back-up if things went wrong?&#39;]

You can see the discomfort in his eyes and the thoughts racing in his mind. But you don&#39;t leave him long to ponder.$a[&#39;The Elder has awakened and he will be guarding the entrance along with Ionut. Your device is not well enough equipped to deal with him. Not now anyway. You will need to increase the power.&#39;]

$rando[&#39;How do you know all of that...?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I told you, silly. Lavius sent me - I&#39;m here to help. And I know that you don&#39;t know how to reconfigure that thing. So if you want our plan to succeed, turn your back and let me configure the device.&#39;]

It seems that your arguments have managed to convince the leader. Reluctantly, he turns away and presents you with the large backpack that is connected to the device on his arm.

The backpack he&#39;s wearing is hosting what looks like a large battery, surrounded by metal cyllinders, capacitors and all sorts of wires. You can hear a low electrical hum coming from it. 

$L[Lavius has gone a long way in his research it seems...]

The device looks like something straight of the 19th century, perhaps from Tesla&#39;s personal sketchbook. However there is more to it. For all the shiny copper and glass, you also spot other, more sinister details. Runes etched in plaques, crystals connected in strange ways. You can&#39;t quite tell where the classical technology ends and the occult begins.

Despite the strange additions to the device, you manage to quickly locate the control board. It has all sorts of knobs and gauges. Luckily for you, you&#39;ve once studied these things.

$a[&#39;I will increase the voltage to maximum,&#39;] you explain to the men, pointing to a knob and turning it all the way up. $a[&#39;This will drain the power very quickly, but should be strong enough to deal with the old Petrescu. Use it sparingly and wait for the right moment.&#39;]

The men look over your shoulder and nod approvingly, though you can tell that they don&#39;t really understand it. $A[Perfect... just what I was counting on!] As you make a grand point of explaining how the voltage should be kept at a max, you discretely turn the amperage way down. $A[This will barely give a zap now... fools!] 

As you finish setting up the device and step back, nobody seems to have noticed your trickery.

$a[&#39;Alright, fellas - you&#39;re all set! I think we should get moving now, before anyone notices my absence.&#39;]

The leader turns around, flexing his arm with the device. He gives you a slightly confused look, but doesn&#39;t find any objection. $rando[&#39;You heard her men! Time for action.&#39;]

The group quickly packs the camp and prepares for departure.

$rando[&#39;Step aside, servant! We can do this the easy way or the hard way!&#39;] The men cheer, lifting their weapons and ready to fight.

$Io[&#39;Get avay!&#39;]

Ionut swings the shovel at the leader, but he dodges swiftly to the side, hitting the servant on his head with a bat. Ionut sways, but doesn&#39;t fall. 

$R[&#39;That washn&#39;t nice!&#39;] comes a voice from above. Just on time, a giant shadow drops from the sky, squashing a figure to the ground. The rest of the group halts.

$rando[&#39;Now, get him when he falls unconscious!&#39;]

The leader swings with his arm, burying the metal device straight in the Elder&#39;s chest. There is a tiny spark that fizzles into the night.

$R[&#39;Ish that all?&#39;]

You can feel the horror set in the group. The men turn towards you with angry stares, but it&#39;s too late. An arm flies off, spraying you with a splatter of blood. The metal contraption hangs on to it, cables torn.

The leader&#39;s scream pierces the night, then stops abruptly, stifled by another spray of blood. The rest of the men forget about you and run for the forest.

You open your eyes.

There are faces all around you, gleeful and cruel. You try to move, but it&#39;s no use. You are tied to a tree with nowhere to go.

You pull your skirt up slightly and give in to the pleasure.

As the vampire&#39;s fingers accelerate, the wet spot on your panties begins to grow. Satisfied with this result, Lavius pushes the thin fabric to side, finally sliding underneath.

$a[&#39;Aaaah!~~&#39;] You bite your lip, stifling a moan, your hands clenching the bench.

$L[&#39;Just relax, my dear. Let&#39;s have some fun!&#39;]

Lavius wraps his other hand around your waist and pulls you closer towards him, then leans in for a kiss. You can hardly resist. As soon as your lips open to welcome him, he pushes his fingers even deeper, making you squirm with pleasure.

His kisses you wildly, invading your mouth with a taste of wine and fruit. Energetic and generous, he continues to finger you with outstanding skill, hitting spots you never knew existed and sending wave after wave of blissful pleasure through your body. When he finally pulls away you are left breathless and shaking, almost at the edge of orgasm.

$L[&#39;What wonderful maids Mihai has found... I wish you were serving **me**, dear. We would have such fun!&#39;]

You meekly nod at him.

$L[&#39;But I promised you food, and a gentleman always keeps his promise. Why don&#39;t you come down here and get your reward?&#39;]

You slide from the bench and get down on the ground, kneeling in front of Lavius. The top of your maid outfits gives him an almost unimpeded view of your $breasts, which seems to produce an effect judging by the growing bulge in his pants.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/bj_maid.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$L[&#39;There&#39;s nothing cuter than a maid on her knees. I have to admit, I thought Mihai was too stuck-up to hire someone like you, but it seems like he&#39;s finally decided to move with the times. But enough of that. Let&#39;s not keep you waiting.&#39;]

Even as he says he won&#39;t keep you waiting, you can see that Lavius takes a great care in unbuckling his belt as slowly and methodically as possible. Your hungry stare probably speaks enough for him. 

$A[That smug bastard....]

You wish you could hate him, but it&#39;s just making you even hornier. As you kneel down on the ground with nothing but a black skirt, you can sense a handful of resiliant stems of grey grass rubbing against your wet slit. You are so hot and sensitive that even that is enough to make you twitch with anticipation.

After taking his sweet time to enjoy your longing look, Lavius finally slips his cock out and grabs your horn, giving you a playful tug towards him.

You lean in forward and open your lips, taking him in your mouth. It isn&#39;t something that you thought you&#39;d see yourself doing in broad day in the middle of the garden, but now that you&#39;re in the act it somehow feels natural to you.

$L[&#39;Mmm, you feel amazing, my dear! The ability to give pleasure - that&#39;s an admirable skill to have.&#39;]

Lavius seems very happy to just lean back and let you do the work for him. Occasionally he gives your horns a little tug, adjusting your pace to his liking. 

As you slide your lips back and forth down his shaft you are lulled into a familiar, pleasant $a[**haze**]. It is a place in your mind that is always there to welcome you. You feel aroused, but it&#39;s more than that. You feel **good**. 

$a[&#39;Mmmmmm...&#39;]

You can&#39;t really moan with your mouth full, but you give out a muffled sound of pleasure. His cock is growing with every motion. It creates an interesting mix of submission and power.

You blush at the thought. Of course lavius doesn&#39;t know that you&#39;ve already had quite the close encounters with the werewolf. Your pussy is growing wetter.

All of your intimate parts are completely exposed and you&#39;re loving it.]

You shove your face all the way down, swallowing the entire length of his cock. You gag a little but remain determined to finish the job. You can feel his cock begin to twitch with pleasure, approaching the final build up to his climax.

With a moan of satisfaction, Lavius empties his load in your mouth. You can feel the bursts come one after the other, filling you with a thick salty liquid.

He grabs you by the horns and takes full control of your body, moving you back and forth to his own pace. All you need to do is keep your mouth available for him.

As he slides you back and forth you are lulled into a familiar, submissive space. It is a place in your mind that is always there to welcome you. Nothing is required of you. It is safe. It is comforting.

For some reason you feel even more turned on by the prospect of serving Lavius. You decide to really work and devote yourself to giving him pleasure.

You  gently take him in your hand and give him a few strokes, before leaning in. You start with a few kisses to the tip, then you open your lips and take a little bit in your mouth. You use your tongue to play with it, building the tension with every slurp

You take your time with this. It makes you happy, it makes you excited. You can feel your own wet pussy begging for a piece of the action, but you know this isn&#39;t about that. It&#39;s about serving **him**. Your own pleasure can wait.

After a long warm up, you finally take him in deeper, sliding your lips back and forth down his already fully erect member. Your mind slips into a familiar, pleasant $a[**haze**]. It is a place of submission and servitude. It is a place that feels good.

Lavius gives you a courteous bow and heads back inside. You take another minute to compose yourself, then follow suit.

You slide from the bench and get down on the ground, kneeling in front of Lavius. The top of your devil gown gives him an almost unimpeded view of your $breasts. The fabric shifts again, increasing the exposed area and tightening around them, which makes your pierced nipples stand out clearly.

The effect seems clear on Lavius, judging by the growing bulge in his pants.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/bj_devil.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$L[&#39;Aren&#39;t I a lucky man, to have a real succubus on her knees for me... I have to admit, I thought Mihai was too stuck-up to hire someone like you, but it seems like he&#39;s finally decided to move with the times. I don&#39;t know where he managed to find you, but I&#39;m impressed. But enough of that. Let&#39;s not keep you waiting.&#39;]

Even as he says he won&#39;t keep you waiting, you can see that Lavius takes a great care in unbuckling his belt as slowly and methodically as possible. Your hungry stare probably speaks enough for him. 

$A[That smug bastard....]

You wish you could hate him, but it&#39;s just making you even hornier. As you kneel down on the ground, the devil&#39;s gown is still keeping your pussy open and exposed. You can feel a handful of resiliant stems of grey grass rubbing against your wet slit. You are so hot and sensitive that even that is enough to make you twitch with anticipation.

After taking his sweet time to enjoy your longing look, Lavius finally slips his cock out and grabs your horn, giving you a playful tug towards him.

$a[&#39;Relax, my good man. I&#39;m just an innocent girl, having a walk, looking for some company...&#39;] You smile seductively and wave a hand non-chalantly to lower their weapons, but are met with dubious looks.

$rando[&#39;Why should we trust you? Don&#39;t play dumb, we can see those horns of yours, demon!&#39;]

$a[&#39;If you see them, then you should know that you are a very, **very** lucky man.&#39;] You step towards the leader confidently and place a hand between his legs, rubbing his package. $a[&#39;If you see these horns you should know that I&#39;m a succubus, and the only thing that I&#39;m looking for is a good meal...&#39;]

You lick your lips, giving him a longing look. You can already feel the $a[**hunger**] rising in your belly, the heat growing between your legs. $A[Gotta stay focused...]

The leader seems a bewildered. The rest of the men begin to lower their weapons. $rando[&#39;If you&#39;re playing with us...&#39;]

Instead of answering you fall to your knees and begin to unbuckle his belt. The rest of the men step closer, making a small circle around you.

Your heart begins to accelerate. $A[Okay Alex, now what? I need to improvise...]

You take the man&#39;s member in your mouth and immediately feel the familiar haze creep in your mind. Hands reach from every direction and begin to fondle you, squeezing your breasts and groping your ass. $in[You feel control slipping away]. Thinking is hard. Your body feels hot. You need to do something, fast.

You see the metallic device on the leader&#39;s arm and you try to discreetly reach and disconnect some of the wires.

$rando[&#39;Hey bitch, what are you doing?&#39;]

He grabs your wrist and you see anger in his eyes. He knows. You open your mouth to respond, but the leader swings swiftly with his arm, hitting you in the stomach. The metal contraption connects with your skin and an electrical shock zaps through your body, making you shake uncontrollably.

You lose your footing and the world swings as you fall forward, [[unconscious]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1519" name="brigands lewd win" tags="camp" position="8784,5734" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/div&gt;

Despite the compromising situation, $in[you feel in control]. You are sexy and seductive, but totally in charge of your faculties. Your lust and hunger are at bay and you are confident that you can use this opportunity to your advantage.

Before long the man groans in pleasure and his seed spills in your mouth, fuelling another charge on your bracelet.

$a[&#39;Ah, this is what I came for. Delicious cum! There&#39;s nothing better in this world.&#39;]

You pull away, licking your lips glutonously and giving the other men a coy look.

You can see a shadow go over his face and his expression sours for the briefest of moments, before returning to an impeccable smile.

$L[&#39;You seem oddly interested, my dear. Did you bring me for a one on one talk in the garden to try to steal me?&#39;]

His grins and wraps his hand around your shoulder pulling you closer.

$a[&#39;You seem like an interesting man to be around. But I would like to be certain that I&#39;m not stepping on any toes.&#39;] You give him a coquettish look.

Lavius laughs and his hand slides casually between your legs, gently rubbing your mound. $L[&#39;It&#39;s no secret that succubi need to feed, dear. There&#39;s no need to feign interest in my humble persona. If you want a meal, all you need to do is aks nicely.&#39;]

The third man comes forward and unzips his pants. He looks dirty and unshaven, reaking of sweat and cheap beer. He presses his cock between your legs rubbing it back and forth until you begin to quiver with anticipation. Satisfied with that result he finally slides it in stealing an involuntary moan from your lips.

The man accelerates his pace, pounding you like a wild hog, and making your entire body jump up and down with every thrust inside you. As quickly as he started, he begins to finish, sliding deep inside you and beginning to grunt.

Your body begins to shake violently and you cry out in a powerful orgasm, spraying juices  over the man&#39;s crotch.

$rand[&#39;You see this, men? This little bitch gets off in learning her place!&#39;]

Before you can even take a few breaths, the man is out and another has taken his place. He slides inside of your dripping pussy, fucking it with loud splashing noises from every thrust.

&#39;She feels fucking amazing! I&#39;ve never been with a succubus before.&#39;

Your moans continue to echo loudly in the camp. You can no longer control yourself. Tied and restricted, with your legs held forcefully spread, the feeling of submission and lust is just too much for you.

The second man cums inside you as well and then switches with the third. You close your eyes, overwhelmed by the sensations. Time after time the men take turns with you, fucking you until your entire body is shaking. You lose all notion of time, drowning completely in the moment.

$rando[&#39;Men, it&#39;s almost time. We need to get goin now.&#39;]

You open your eyes and meet the gaze of the henchman currently fucking you. The dirty bastard is rubbing your clit with a finger, which causes your pussy to shamelessly twitch around his cock.

&#39;But what about the whore?&#39; he asks, pushing a few more thrusts in.

$rando[&#39;She&#39;s done enough. Time to say goodbye.&#39;]

You are suddenly all too aware of the blade pressed against your throat. For a moment you had completely forgotten about it, but now it&#39;s the only thing you feel. Cold and sharp, the knife presses against your skin. Your gut twists into a knot.

$a[&#39;NO WAI-&#39;]

The knife sinks in, sliding your throat in half. A gush of crimson splashes down your breasts and (link-reveal-goto:&quot;everything goes black&quot;, &quot;DIESUCCUBUS&quot;)[

Ionut swings the shovel at the leader, but he dodges swiftly to the side, hitting the servant on his head with a bat. Ionut sways, but doesn&#39;t fall. 

Unfuriated, the leader swings with his arm, burying the metal device straight into Ionut&#39;s chest. There is a tiny spark that fizzles into the night.

Ionut smacks the leader on the head, knocking him down. Unfortunately, the rest of the men are surrounding you.

&#39;You&#39;ll pay for this, bitch!&#39;

There is nowhere left to go. Ionut is still too far to help you. You manage to dodge the first two swings, but a third one catches you from behind. You stare at the blade sticking out of your chest, a stream of blood soaking your $suit.

Eagerly, the rest of the men flock around you and you give in to the task of servicing them all to their heart&#39;s content.

You suck and lick and kiss, over and over again. With every load down your throat another bead blossoms in crimson, until soon enough your bracelet is completely recharged.

$A[This turned into quite the feast...]

As the beads turn crimson, your $a[**hunger**] subsides and you find yourself more and more $in[in control]. You can do whatever you want to them. They are completely under your spell.

Confidence fills you. Even on your knees, you are the one calling the shots. $A[Being a succubus can be quite exciting...!]

You open your mouth to object, but Sabrina hushes you with a finger. $S[&#39;I am not blaming, only stating. The male orgasm follows a simple trajectory, and you can hardly be blamed for following what is natural to you. Now, as a woman, you have a glimpse from the other side - a glimpse of a path with no single destination, a complex journey of giving and receiving. In reality it is a path that anyone can walk - given enough time and perseverance - but it seems that in this instance, fate has forced your hand, **sister**.&#39;] As she says the last word, Sabrina grins at you and you feel her hand sliding between your thighs.

You close your eyes and abandon yourself to her. The pleasure is building, but you can tell that it&#39;s not about the destination. It&#39;s the journey, the exploration.

She liftes her arms above her head, crossing her wrists as if bound by an invisible chain.

$a[&#39;You are gorgeous,&#39;] you blurt out, before leaning in to bury your face in her breasts. You kiss them all over, gliding your hands up her perfect curves, her neck, shoulders, and arms, where you press her down as your kisses move from her breasts to her neck. you playfully lick and bite her ear, reveling in the pleasure of her soft skin.

When you finally lift your head up your eyes meet. $S[&#39;It&#39;s okay, sis. Follow your instincts.&#39;]

You swap your grip to hold her wrists with one hand and slide the other between her legs. You feel her welcoming warmth and her shivers of pleasure. Her pussy is growing wetter with every caress of your fingers, and just like a sister echo, you can feel your own slit starting to drip down on her.

$S[&#39;Fine. Follow me and do **exactly** as I tell you.&#39;]

Sabrina takes a piece of chalk and gets on the floor, redrawing the pentagram and the runes around it. $S[&#39;It&#39;s important that the lines are intact when starting the ceremony,&#39;] she explains, going meticulously over every line and symbol. When she&#39;s satisfied with her work, she steps back and invites you to stand in the center. When you&#39;re there, she places metal cuffs on your wrists and ankles, chaining you to the pentagram.

$a[&#39;Uhm... is this really necessary...?&#39;]

$S[&#39;You&#39;re the one who wanted this, sis,&#39;] she replies with a flat tone. $S[&#39;Unless you&#39;ve changed your mind?&#39;]

The complex incantation is a real tongue twister, and you feel the occult energies around you swhirl like an angry and chaotic puddle, instead of forming neat streams and pattenrs.

The pentagram glows a deep red, then fades back to regular chalk. The spell fizzles.

The air vibrates, thick and heavy. The pentagram begins to glow a deep red, the runes around it coming to life and wiggling like worms under a scorching sun.

$S[&#39;Great work, sis! Now just stand still for a moment...&#39;]

The red glow around you continues to intensify. On the edges of the blinding red you can see black shadows begin to form, as if the void itself is starting to leak from beneath the floor. Suddenly the room grows darker and you begin to hear a strange hollow sound, coming from everywhere and nowhere.

Your vision shifts and a wave of nausea hits you. The room is spinning around you. The darkness on the edges is rising higher and creeping towards the center, towards you. You feel every heartbeat in your chest. The hairs on your naked skin stand on edge as the black flames are closing in. 

You are naked. Defenceless. Vulnerable.

The dark flames are closing in. Suddenly the darkness erupts, condensing into swirling black tentacles. They are all around you, your neasea making them look like a swarm of black algae on some alien sea floor.

You feel the first slimy touch wrap around your leg and you shudder. A sense of impending doom washes over your mind, floosing all rational thought. $A[I have to get out, I have to get out, I have to get out...]

You spring to your feet, leaping out of the pentagram. For a brief moment the tentacles reach out to grab you, but then the spell fizzles and they disintegrate back into shadows. Slowly, the room returns to normal.

Your body is bound by the tentacles, but nothing seems to be happening. You slowly open your eyes, only to be greeted by a squirming black mass right in front of your face.

$a[&#39;Eeek!&#39;]

You recoil instinctively, twisting your neck back. In your current situation you can&#39;t move away very much, but you manage to gain a few precious inches.
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pentagram_trial_tentacles.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A massive tentacle has rizen right in front of you, its end dangling suspiciously close to your lips. 

The black fleshy mass looks even more repulsive than the rest of the tentacles. From up close you can see its muscles pulsating beneath the slimy skin, a row of irregular shaped suction cups lining the inner side of it. There are other, stranger things on it too, organic formations that you can&#39;t identify nor describe, with shapes that twitch ominously with every wriggle of the tentacle. A dark liquid is oozing out of its end and dripping down right on your naked breasts. 

The tentacle extends the tip forward, like an invitation.

Conflicting emotions wrestle within you. A part of you is utterly disgusted by the unearthly abomination, but another, deeper part is compelled by the proposition. The heat in your belly grows and you find yourself dancing on the edge between your human instincts and your supernatural lust.

Your lips hesitantly part and you hold your breath, transfixed on the horror wriggling infront of you.

The tentacle inches forward, the tip dancing just at the edge of your mouth. A drop of the black liquid drips down on your lower lip. It feels bitter and sweet and so wrong and so right. You can feel all of the tentacles holding your body firmly in place. Their gentle caresses have turned into an iron grip.

You give in wrap your lips around the offering, beginning to suck the black tentacle. Immediately the rest of the tendrils relax, loosening their hold on your limbs. Their touch becomes tender, almost caring. They slither between your thighs, teasing and promissing their unnatural debauchery. Your whole body sinks into their slimy embrace, shivering in pleasure and anticipation.

You know what you have to do. It&#39;s so simple. And yet, almost impossible.

The pulsating black tentacle is just too repulsive. You try to force yourself to open your mouth and not think about it, but you just can&#39;t. The black mass has a putrid stench and is covered in unnatural shapes and bulges that look like living fungi covering a corpse.

Despite your best efforts, you twist your head to the side, feeling sick to your stomach.

$a[&#39;Get away from me!&#39;]

The tentacle makes a hissing sound, wiggling angrily towards your face.

$S[&#39;You should have taken the offer, sis,&#39;] comes a distant voice.

You continue sycking on the hideous tentacle in a rhythmic trance, your lips moving back and forth around the uneven, wriggling texture. 

Drop after drop, the thick, black liquid oozes into your mouth and drips down your throat. It&#39;s sweet bitterness is unlike anything you&#39;ve ever tasted before. Strong and intoxicating, you feel as if it permeates your flesh, twisting and corrupting it in a subtle yet undeniable way.

A sense of madness creeps upon you, but you have no choice but to embrace it. You no longer see the room around you, or hear Sabrina&#39;s voice. Darkness is creeping all around and now the darkness is making its way inside of you, drop by drop, sliding down your throat.

Your mind is spiraling. Something is comming. You know it in your bones. And you are ready for it. Your nipples stand shamefully erect, your holes gaping open. The tentacles are gently spreading your ass cheeks apart, but you know that it&#39;s for something else. Something that is yet to come.

The black tentacle in your mouth begins to tremble excitedly, then the drops abruptly stop. You can feel the tension building and you double your efforts, sucking the stem with a vigor and depravity that you didn&#39;t know you had.

Finally the tentacle erups, unloading a massive spurt of viscous liquid straight into your throat. You can sense something bubbling inside of it, something unnatural and *evil*. But it&#39;s too late to worry about that now.

Something approaches your entrance and panic begins to grip your mind.

$A[No, I can&#39;t...! Not with this thing....!]

You thought that you were prepared for the ritual, but you only expected the tentacles, not this abomination. $A[Was this even supposed to happen?! Did Sabrina know? Oh my god, what if the spell went horribly wrong... I think I messed up...]

You try to look around and call for help, but everything is dark. Outside of the edges of the pentagram, there is only darkness as far as you can see. $A[Am I even in her room still?! Help!]

Despite the rising panic in your mind, your body is completely still. You feel paralized, completely unable to move.

$A[No, no, no, this can&#39;t be happening....!&#39;]

A twitching, fleshy tube prods against your entrance. The dangling legs of the abomination grip you by the hips, guiding you towards the inevitable. You feel the folds of your pussy opening up as the unspeakable pushes inside of you.

You know what you have to do.

The knowledge seeps into your mind like rot in old wood. You can feel it penetrating your thoughts.

Your body twitches in anticipation. Your heart races. The creature awaits your offering. You slowly stick your ass out and wait.
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pentagram_god_inside.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
You can feel the moment when it connects. It presses against your backside and begins to push in. You can feel its bulbous and irregular surface pulsate in an unnatural yet organic way.

$G[&#39;Good acolytes shall be rewarded.&#39;]

You can tell that the creature is happy with you. It gently grabs your hips with its long, dangling legs and pulls you in. You are ready to accept it.
(if: $mb_fascination&gt;0)[
Just as you breathe a sigh of relief, an intrusive thought appears from a weird part of your mind. $A[What if I wasn&#39;t obedient...? What would it decide to do to me then...?] 

The unspeakable horror seems satisfied with you for now, but you can&#39;t help but wonder what would happen if you decided to pull away from it...

You continue struggling while the black tentacle pushes its ozzing tip against your lips. Despite its efforts to get inside of your mouth, you manage to clench your jaw and fight it off.

There is a low hissing sound and the tentacle angrily wraps around your neck, squeezing it tight.

$a[&#39;Aaargh!&#39;]

You struggle to breathe, clawing at it but unable to get a firm grasp to get it off. 

The tentacle suddenly retracts, pulling your neck down with it. Your head is forced to the floor and your ass is lifted shamefully in the air.

$S[&#39;Hold on, I&#39;ll try to help...&#39;] 

Up until this point the rest of the tentacles were just holding you down, but now they begin to wriggle excitedly, closing in on your crotch. Something slithers between your folds and before you can even scream one of the black tendrils is pushing inside your pussy.

$a[&#39;Argh...!&#39;] 

The grip around your neck tightens again and your vision darkens. Your nails dig into the floor as you struggle to push your head up. At the same time the tentacle&#39;s pace accelerates inside of you, forcing a squirt of juices and an embarrassing clenching of your pussy around its tormentor. 

Another contraction around your neck almost makes you pass out, all the while building you towards an orgasm.

You twist your head up and stare at the horror that is slowly hovering above you.

The creature looks like a giant insect, and yet nothing like any earthly living form. A massive bloated monstrosity, its body is morphing and changing before your eyes, taking shapes and colors that your mind can&#39;t comprehend.
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pentagram_god_hover.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Staring at the colossal creature, it feels like it towers for miles, as if its distorted and ineffable body is larger than any earthly skies. Distances and dimensions lose their meaning. 

All you know is that it is above and you are below. You feel its infinite legs dangle around you. Without looking, you know that something is extending down towards you, to your tiny frame, your insignificant presence, your shameful and lusty holes that do not deserve the unspeakable grandeur that is about to defile them.

You are gripped with terror. All that is human within you is screaming to run, to resist, to prevent the unholy perversion that is about to take place. And yet, you know that you have to accept it. You *want* to accept it.

If there are any gods listening to your pleas, they do not reach out to help you. Luminescent tendrils hang over your head, dancing slowly in a mesmerizing way.

A presence washes over your mind and suddenly you gain an Understanding. You understand that you have failed. You were given the rarest opportunity to give yourself to something Greater and you tried to run away in fear.

Unfathomable $a[Shame] washes over you.

You now understand what you&#39;ve done and why you must accept this $a[Punishment].

Tears continue to roll down your face while your Undeserving holes are stuffed with the dark essence. Had you accepted it willingly, things would have been different. You know this for a fact, you understand it at the core of your mind.

Just as you understand why you must accepts the consequences of your failures.

Having gone beyond salvation, you allow your sentence to play out. Finally breaking out of your paralisis, your hips begin to push back against the unholy tube, a futile attempt to rince the guilt of your failure with the shame of your lust. 

Your body is burning.

Every spurt of darkness inside your womb swells your belly with more of the black corruption, disolving your sanity and unleashing the wickedness within you.

$a[&#39;Take me! I&#39;m ready!&#39;]

You begin to utter unthinkable things, professing how undeserving you are of the honor of being punished by the magnificent creature.

You feel it pump more and more of the Blackness within, and you open yourself willingly, weeping tears of shame and joy as you continue to grind against it, helping to punish yourself for your ungratefullness.

$a[&#39;Aaaah! Fill me!&#39;]

All of your senses are mixing together. The luminescent tendrils are dancing above your head and your ass is greedily grinding on the pulsating member.

The creature sinks in deep, defiling your mortal body with its grotesque member. You have become a willing offering to its desires.

As the creature begins to pump something inside of you, you wonder vaguely if this is some mighty old god that you have encountered, or just one among numerous others, attracted to your lust like some sort of abominable bee drawn to your nectar.

Your hole stretches further and something viscous splashes inside of you.

$a[&#39;Aaah...&#39;]

It feels strangely good, both terribly wrong and deeply intoxicating. You feel a sense of fullness and a perverse satisfaction of the act, of how helpless and utterly at the creature&#39;s mercy you are.

$a[&#39;Aaaaaahhh...&#39;]

Another spurt of viscous black corruption is injected inside of you, pushing the previous deeper into your gut. You can&#39;t see it but you *know* it, instinctively. You can feel the substance seeping into your flesh. You can smell the blackness of it. You can hear it bubbling in your gut. You can taste its abominable smell.

The devil&#39;s gown ripples over your flesh and you give in to the transformation completely, letting the illusion flourish. It might be just smoke and mirrors, but what does it matter?

$a[&#39;Mmmm....&#39;]

The servant&#39;s hand grabs your horns and pulls you closer. You let him take back some of the control, his pleasure intertwining with your own pleasure of giving. You find yourself hungry and impatient for his eventual release and the satisfaction of the meal that you&#39;re about to have.

$Io[&#39;Avrghh...!&#39;]

The servant&#39;s cock begins to throb in your mouth and you accelerate your pace. You&#39;re almost there. You can feel it. All you need to do is to push him (link-reveal:&quot;over the edge.&quot;)[(set: $ionutBJCUM to 1)(rerun:?scene)

Catching his second wind in an instnat, Ionut eagerly grabs your hanging braids, arching your back backwards and pressing his cock against your butt.

You relax and lower your defences, letting his big misshapen member slowly slide in, stretching your tiny ballerina ass. Ionut lets out a long grunt of pure satisfaction, then pulls back and rams it back in  with such vigor and readiness as if the entire Bolshoï Theatre is watching his performance.

$a[&#39;Aaah!&#39;]

He continues pounding your ass and you give in to the pleasure and the rhythm. Is it just your imagination, or are you somehow even smaller and slimmer? Or has Ionut grown larger? You can feel tight and powerful muscles underneath his scarified skin. You can taste fear and excitement in your mouth. You can swear that his cock is even bigger now and your tight ass can feel all the curves and bumps as it slides in and out. You can almost hear a distant orchestra playing somewhere and your tiny hands grabbing onto the soft folds of red curtains, your lips hard pressed to stifle your tiny moans from the audience on the other side...

$Io[&#39;Natasha!!&#39;] cries out Ionut, pulling hard on your golden tails.

You get down on the floor, rising your ass towards the black woman. Sharp, black fingers quickly push your garments aside and you feel *something* rubbing against your naked folds, waiting and teasing.

$E[&#39;Tsk, tsk. Wet already? You must really want it, girl.&#39;]

*Something* prods at your entrance and you can feel the arousal rising. You didn&#39;t come here for this, but now that you&#39;re in the position and have no choice, your body is silently screaming for it.

$a[&#39;Aaaahh!&#39;] A moan escapes your lips as you feel the *ovipositor* push inside your wet pussy, sinking deeper and deeper.

You suddenly remember that Felicia is somewhere, watching you. The thought makes your face glow red and you look down at the floor, ashamed.

It doesn&#39;t take long until you feel a hard round object moving through the stem. It stretches your entrance and makes its way deeper, ready to be softly deposited in your pussy.

$A[I need to excite her more... make her really get into this...]

You begin moving your hips back and forth, stimulating the black creature even more.

You can sense the round her object ready to be dropped inside of you. The *thing* inside your pussy is twitching and you can tell that the spider woman is also getting excited.

$a[&#39;Wait! I want it **in**. Really **IN**.&#39;]

You push back as hard as you can, sensing the ovipositor sink all the way inside of you, pressing against the entrance of your womb. 

$E[&#39;Tsk. This would not be wise, girl. Getting it out would be difficult. Tsk. Tsk&#39;]

$a[&#39;I don&#39;t care! I want to feel you inside me. I want to feel **it** inside me.&#39;]

You can sense Elise hesitating, and you push back even more, guiding the tip of the ovipositor to penetrate your innermost parts. The sensation is exhilarating. Your entire belly is burning with desire. You can feel your ovaries almost exploding.

The ovipositor twitches and the egg is pushed forward, sliding past all defences. It feels hard and warm and snug. Your eyes roll up and Elise gives out a groan of satisfaction.

The ovipositor begins to tremble and you sense another hard, round object travelling down its shaft. You remain in positions, legs spread and tube waiting to push straight into your womb.

You can tell that Elise is definitely distracted, her normally confident and cold voice now sounding almost intimate.

$a[&#39;That... must be very frustrating for you.&#39;]

$E[&#39;Tsk. It is, girl. You can&#39;t imagine. But it doesn&#39;t matter - what Mihai can&#39;t give, another may offer.&#39;]

Suddenly you feel something cold and slimy touch your foot.

You stand frozen, holding your breath. Your heart is pounding like crazy. The slimy thing coils up your leg like a snake, methodically exploring the new territory. 

Soon it reaches your loins and you feel the tip burrow between your legs, following your dripping juices.

$a[&#39;Aaaah!] Even your cry comes out squeakier and somehow different.

Ionut pushes himself deeper and lets out a long grunt of pure satisfaction as your tiny asshole is desperately stretched around him. Then he slowly pulls almost all the way back, only to slide back in with such vigour and readiness as if the entire Bolshoï Theatre is watching his performance.

He continues pounding your ass and you give in to the pleasure and the rhythm. Is it just your imagination, or are you somehow even smaller and slimmer? Or has Ionut grown larger?

You can swear that his cock is even bigger now and your tight ass can feel all the curves and bumps as it slides in and out. You can almost hear a distant orchestra playing somewhere and your tiny hands grabbing onto the soft folds of red curtains, your lips hard pressed to stifle your tiny moans from the audience on the other side...

Slowly and silently, you creep towards the game room, ready to turn back at the slightest sign of a presence.

Thankfully, it&#39;s completely empty. The pool table is just as you left it, with an empty glass of whiskey and a dying cigar smoldering on the edge.

You breathe a sigh of relief and pick up the pace, quickly traversing the room and heading into the library.

You follow the familiar sense of reality warping around you, take 4 left turns and a right, coiling inwards and inwards until the walls stretch into endless shelves and you come upon a familiar desk.

$A[Thank goodness she&#39;s still alive... but seems to be pretty out of it...]

You take the scissors and begin to gently cut through the cobweb wrapped around Felicia.

As you go down from her neck to her torso, the white silky sheets part away, revealing her naked body underneath.

$A[Oh, right...]

You feel stupid for not expecting this. Of course Elise would have undressed her before spinning her web. Seeing her like this raises conflicting emotions and you try to avoid staring too much and just focus on getting the job done.

You bend your head down and press your lips against Felicia&#39;s mouth, pushing in a deep burst of air into her lungs.

The cat gives a small cough and twitches, but her eyes remain closed.

$A[Come on, Felicia...]

You breathe into her again. Her lips are sweet and sour, and almost inert. You can swear you can also taste something strange on them, something that reminds you of green glassy eyes and long black legs...

You kiss her lips again. Soft and colder. $A[Colder than they should be].

Are you too late? The thought cuts deep. It would be a real shame, after all that effort. 

Your hand reaches under your garments, between your legs. $A[What am I doing? No. It&#39;s okay. Follow your instincts, Alex...]

Your fingers begin to rub and a small heat spreads up to your belly. Your breathing becomes quick and shallow. The $in[bracelet] begins to glow hot on your wrist.

One look at the time lets you know that you ought to be back at the reception. You leave Ionut to his grizly work in the basement and sprint back to the entrance.

You get down on all fours and crawl towards her. She holds the cards now. You understand your position.

Reaching Elise you take her leg in your hand and kiss it, letting your saliva drool down her toes. Her skin feels hard and coarse, but you don&#39;t mind.

$a[&#39;Please, mistress, use me and satiate my hunger...&#39;] you whimper.  

You look up to the black creature and she looks down, ~~8~~2 black eyes with a green metallic sheen, staring at you with a mix of pity and satisfaction.

$E[&#39;Tsk, where would you be without me, girl?&#39; You&#39;re lucky that I like you.You want favor after favor... hope you are ready to pay the price.&#39;] She runs a long black finger up your throat, lifting your chin up.

$a[&#39;I am...&#39;]

You hold your legs apart as Elise climbs on top of you, her black leather standing out against the whiteness of the sheets.

$E[&#39;Here&#39;s a little taste, my pet&#39;] 

Her ~~multiple~~ arms descend all around you, enveloping your body in caresses. Her large, round abdomen lowers down, positioning in front of your opening. *Something* extends further, pushing into you as the ~~creature~~ woman continues to caress you.

$a[&#39;Aahh!&#39;] You give a soft moan, sensing it sink deeper.

$E[&#39;Hold steady, now! You asked for this.&#39;]

Your vision blurs and your eyes roll, giving in to sensation and pleasure. Something fills you up, over and over again, so abundant that the pressure inside you grows and stretches your womb. The bracelet glows on your wrist and you feel another bead blossom in crimson.

You feel a final squirt inside of you and the ~~spider~~ woman climbs down, leaving you panting on the bed.

$E[&#39;Now you are filled with my seed, girl. This time it will not have... consequences. Tsk. But remember - if you fail...&#39;]

Elise presses a black hand against your inflated tummy. $E[&#39;You will take her place.&#39;]

You swallow hard, your head spinning.

$E[&#39;Now be gone. Take her if you care that much. But be ready to bear the **consequences**]

The last word hangs in the air ominously. You swalow again and nod. Elise slides sideways across the room, elgantly dropping the coccoon from the ceiling and thrusting it into your hands.

$E[&#39;There, tsk. Do what you must, but do it quickly.&#39;]

You try to get up, but instead awkwardly roll of the pool table and collapse on the floor. Your ass hurts and you quickly realize that you won&#39;t be able to easily get the ball out.

$A[Just my luck...]

You take a deep breath and get up. It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;ll deal with it later. You are not doing this for yourself anyway. There&#39;s a bigger picture at hand. And someone needs you.

Slowly and silently, you creep towards the reception, ready to turn react at the slightest sign of a presence.

Thankfully, there&#39;s no one around. You quickly fetch Felicia&#39;s body from under the desk and pick up the pace towards the library.

Your body shakes uncontrollably and the bracelet vibrates, scortching your skin. A crimson bead turns dark and you feel the energy flow through you, pouring into the body on the floor.

As your kiss finally ends and you lift up your head, Felicia is looking at you. There&#39;s something bittersweet in her gaze and you feel both guilt and relief to see her awake again.

$M[&#39;Hello there, my dear succubus.&#39;]

You silently give her a hand, helping her to get up. She takes a couple of wobbly steps and stretches like a cat, unbothered by her nudity.

$a[&#39;Are you okay?&#39;]

The potion has worked. With some effort you manage to pull yourself out of the ground. You stand, victorious, and wobbling, your naked feet digging into the soft soil. Your body is shaking and your mind is barely able to focus over the haze, but you&#39;ve done it.

The worms have been chased away.

$A[Now... for the real deal]

You know that you&#39;re not done yet. The mark burns on your belly, prodding you to action.

$O[Go....]

You close your eyes and try to follow the pull. You walk through the cavernous space, a cold draft drying the sweat from your naked body. It all feels completely surreal. Crawling naked through the void of the underground crypt. Perhaps you are having a dream?

You still don&#39;t know your purpose here, but you know that failing it would mean your certain demise. The mark on your belly is softly pulsating. There is a sinking feeling that things will take a turn for the worse, but you have no choices but to try and hope for the best.

The temperature is somehow rising. Your mind is telling you that the crypt is damp and cold, but your body is feeling $a[hot] and steamy.

You continue your descent, barefoot and naked, beads of sweat glistening on your skin.

You are on edge, waiting and ready.

Something slimy touches your foot and you jerk, your heart skipping a beat. The worm is small and slithers away immediately.

You breathe a sigh of relief. 

After what seems like an eternity, the staircase opens into a large underground void and the stone floor gives way to a soft, moist soil. The walls vanish and you are truly faced with darkness.

Your eyes open and your heart skips a beat. You thought you had already dealt with the creatures below.

A hand squeezes your wrist and pulls it down, sinking into the soft soil. Before you can react, another one follows, and then two more around your ankles. Your body is suddenly half-buried underground, with only your head and torso still sticking out.

You begin to struggle, but it&#39;s no use. The sinking hands have an iron grip, holding you from all sides.

$G[I can&#39;t have you going back... to tell them what you&#39;ve done... and besides... to have a real succubus here... that is a treat...]

The hands suddenly move underground, spreading your legs apart. Your pussy is stretched open and defenceless, with not even an inch away to go. An invisible finger begins to caress it, forcing a moan beyond your control.

More hands emerge, griping your breasts and ass, caressing your stomach and back. You feel like you&#39;re swimming in a sea of darkness, fresh soil, and hands.

You spin around. The presence is back. Your hairs stand on edge. The soil begins to shift under your feet.

You continue to suck on the finger, wrapping your soft lips around the black hand. You know almost subconsciously that stopping would mean angering the unnatural presence.

A ray of sunshine stubbornly seeps through the stained window glass, warming your face. Your body feels warm and comfortable. You want to stay here just for a while longer, enjoying the peaceful comfort of sleep.

Despite your best efforts, your eyelids twitch from the sun and you open your eyes, suddenly awake. The experience of coming back is familiar to you now, but this time, it is also somehow $A[different].

$A[Wait, what happened?]

Your head feels heavy this morning. You sit in your bead, running a heand through your hair. You end up absent-mindedly rubbing one of your horns. It feels so natural on your head now, like it&#39;s always been there.

With great effort, memories of your past life bubble up to the surface of your consciousness. The men. The lair. The machine. You shiver.

$A[Those bastards...!]

But you feel like you&#39;re missing something. Something happened after that. Or did it?

You make a few light skips around the room, making your $breasts jiggle. You feel good. You feel $in[alive].

You notice that the bracelet on your wrist has $cri[5 crimson beads] joyously shining in the morning light.

Your mind glances over this peculiar observation and you continue pacing the room cheerfully. When you pass in front of the mirror, you catch a glimpse of something that draws your attention.

You pause in front of the mirror, examining your naked body. Of course, there are the things you&#39;d expect to see - your horns, your curves, your dark flowing hair. But there is something new.

Just below your belly, a dark tattoo is shining on your skin, covering the area right on top of your womb. It&#39;s made of strange black symbols that you can&#39;t understand and the lines of ink almost seem to be moving.

You reach and touch the $in[tattoo] with your hand. It feels warm, almost $in[alive].

Suddenly the room swings wildly and you fall down on your knees. You see a dark forest with eternal trees. A sunless sky and a desecrated ground. A shadowy presence looming over you, carving a mark on your lifeless body.

You open your eyes, panting.

$A[It wasn&#39;t a dream...!]

The mark on your body is as real as your horns. The final bits of memory come back to your mind and the puzzle is complete.

You take a few more minutes to compose yourself and calm down. $A[It&#39;s okay... I&#39;ve been through worse...] 

You remember that the entity said something about calling you later, which sounded ominous and vague. $A[Is it going to come for my first born or something...?]

After some wandering in the dark, your feet stumble on something other than damp soil. It&#39;s a stone surface, followed by another one. A staircase.

$G[Come...]

The pull is getting stronger and you climb up, finding yourself on top of what feels like a mound in the middle of the cavernous void. You can feel empty space all around you. Empty, but somehow *watching*.

A soft glow begins to emanate from the ground. It&#39;s as faint as fluorescence, but in the total pitch of the crypt it feels almost like a beacon. 

A tremor shakes the soil and you can see the surface bubbling in front of you as something is slowly pushed out from beneath.

Your eyes widen. $A[What the...]

There is a big, dark.... $O[**object**] that has erupted out. Its nature and purpose are unquestionable.

The mark on your tummy sends a slow pulse, rewarding you with a wave of pleasure. Some of your fear fades, replaced by acceptance.

The ground vibrates again and a hand reaches from underneath, grabbing your ankle and pulling you down.

They feel deeply wrong, like a perversion to life. You can feel an air of madness to them, as if deaf voices speaking to you, voices that you cannot hear but feel their words regardless, inciting you towards unspeakable actions.

Suddenly the $O[object] beneath you squirts a load into you and your pussy instinctively tightens, clenching around the rigid shaft.

The anticipation is building in your chest with every breath. Time feels like a distant memory in the total darkness of the cavernous space, where all of your sensations are heightened to the extreme.

You can taste the earth on your tongue. You can hear the soil shifting as the creatures tunnel through it. You can smell them too - an intense, saturated smell of death and decay.

After a little more teasing, the creature finally plunges in. It contracts and expands, making its way forward with each convulsion. You feel it making its way deeper and deeper, with grim determination that promises that the worst is yet to come.

Soon you feel it reach a threshold inside of you, something deep in your belly. A gentle pressure begins to build.

With every new egg deposited inside you, your belly bulges forward and you feel rounder and heavier. 

$A[Aaah!]

The pleasure is overwhelming, but there is something else. As the $in[mark] burns on your tummy, you know that this is $in[not what was meant to happen].

You had to do something else and $O[you failed]. This is your punishment.

Your body shakes with lust and madness. Every new egg pushed molds your tummy into an incubator for your invaders. As more and more eggs come everything begins to mix together, the squirming mass of worms around you and the worms inside you, the earth, the soil, the lust, the death.

Darkness and madness descend.

You relax your body, accepting whatever is about to come.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/worms_succ2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
Deep inside you, a barrier breaks and the thing pushes into your innermost space. 

$A[Aaah!]

Your cervix stretches and the intruder lodges itself firmly. 

Something begins to change. You feel the worm trembling and squirming, but it&#39;s no longer pushing forward. Then something wide arrives at the entrance of your folds, stretching you wide open as it passes the threshold and sinks into your pussy.

$A[Mmm...]

You feel the hard bulge travel along the worm&#39;s body inside your pussy, pushed forward by its contractions. The journey ends when it passes through your cervix and with grim inevitability the egg is squeezed out directly into your womb.

You knew this was going to happen. You lean back into the soft soil, enjoying the growing fullness that comes with each new egg.

You have reached your limit. Professed all of your sins. Unearthed every ounce of corruption and depravity.

Your belly is now big and round and it feels incredibly heavy. You can feel something battling inside, pushing to get out. The mark on your womb grows hotter and hotter.

$a[&#39;Aaaarghhh...!&#39;]

The hands gently lay you to lie down and you are finally free from your prison. The soil is damp under your back. With your legs spread in the air, you begin to push.

The creature erupts from within you almost effortlessly. It feels like shadow and smoke, not flesh and bones. You cannot see it, but you can feel its presence, lingering in the space around you. Just as quickly as you grew big, your body is returning to normal.

$G[Very good... you have born me a wonderful servant... consider your debt... repaid...]

The mark on your womb pulsates one last time with its unnatural warmth, then quiets down. A part of the haze and madness is lifted from your mind.

The image of Felicia being helpless flashes vividly in your mind. Worse still, now you are the one being helpless. 

You can feel your tummy growing and becoming rounder and heavier. It feels like a deserving atonement for your actions.

Beyond your control, your hips move back and forth ever so subtly, pleasuring yourself on the dark $O[object] underneath you.

You squirt a barrage of juices down the shaft of the dark $O[object].

$a[&#39;I was trapped in the pit and it- it used me as a surrogate... filled me with its eggs...&#39;]

Ever so slowly, you get up from the ground. The crypt feels eerily quiet. The hands are gone, and so is the presence, along with your child.

Your child.

You shiver.

You start walking in the darkness, thinking of everything that has happened. Are you really that corrupt and depraved? Or just struggling for survival?

$A[Damn it... everything is messing with my head...]

You are a demon now. Or at least turning into one. You wonder if you&#39;ll ever be able to turn back, to be that regular Alex again. You wonder if you still want to.

As you walk, you notice that the two $O[cursed objects] are still dangling from your nipples. They seem to have quieted down and are no longer messing with your head. You decide to deal with them later.

The mark on your belly is also still there. You can&#39;t see it, but you&#39;re sure of it.

You climb up from the crypt, one step at a time. You are emotionally and physically exhausted.

Soon, a dim light appears ahead of you and torches soon follow, spreading ghostly shadows into the stairway.

A little farther ahead you find a heap on the floor. Your clothes. $A[I guess I was expecting what would happen down there...]

At last, you are almost back to the surface. Through a small window in the stone walls surrounding you, you can see a patch of the sky. The summer air rushes to your nostrils and you take a deep breath of the mountain and the pines.

It feels so much better than damp soil and dead things.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1767" name="patreon.statement" tags="" position="2565,2402" size="100,100">Dear supporters,

As we announced on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/important-and-v-59004499&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patreon post here &lt;/a&gt;, in November 2021 we were contacted by Patreon staff and given an ultimatum to remove part of the content or face the termination of the project.

Given the circumstances, we complied, but we would like to take the time to provide you with more details:

**What was removed?**
We had to remove the scenes with the werewolf, 2 of Sabrina&#39;s trainings, 1 of the pit of death options, all of Gwtllgi&#39;s content, as well as 1 of Elise&#39;s scenes.

**Is the content ever coming back?**
The content will not be coming back while we are on Patreon, however this does not mean that it&#39;s never coming back. We are actively exploring other solutions.

**What are your plans for the future?**
Our main priority is to finish the project as quickly as possible. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffZ7f6yVw-BLj_LeffCraYAC8HY-K2Bhlmx-I2k5wGm1Vhdw/viewform&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our survey&lt;/a&gt; it was clear that the overwhelming sentiment of our fans is to move forward and use the support to push Chapter 2 and 3 to completion, delivering the end product for everyone to enjoy.

Please feel free to fill out the survey and leave your thoughts.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1768" name="pit escape" tags="deathpit" position="13396,1069" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt;

You died here once before, but you won&#39;t die here today. The darkness condenses around you and powerful wings propel you upwards, leaping through the air and out of the predator&#39;s grasp. 

You manage to sustain the flight for only a handful of seconds, but it&#39;s enough. You land in another pile of trash and bones, which cushions your fall. 

As you lift your head up, the walls of the pit are much closer, and so is the door.

$A[I&#39;m almost there!!]

You scramble to get up, sending a skull bouncing down the pile and splashing into something. There is a sound of movement closing in on your new location, but you have enough of a head start.

You sprint through the decaying debris, abandoning stealth for speed. Now there&#39;s movement from other sides as well, coming towards you. You try to ignore it.

Now that $in[you can see in the dark], it&#39;s easier to navigate the pit without constantly slipping and tripping. You focus your efforts on a final sprint, climbing up the ridges of the pit, up and up towards $in[the door].

Finally, your fingers wrap around the metal rings of the door. It&#39;s made of heavy wood and reinforced with steel edges, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be locked. You push and one wing creaks open, just enough to allow you to slip into the hallway beyond.

You follow the stone hallway, guided by your new vision. It slopes upwards, giving you hope that you will emerge on the surface soon.

You place a hand on your racing heart, trying to slow it down.

$A[It&#39;s okay, Alex, you&#39;ve got this...]

You can still smell the stench of death and *decay* lingering behind you. The pit from which you emerged, the pit that had once consumed you.

You feel pretty proud to be walking out of it alive, though you can&#39;t shake the feeling that you&#39;ve left another piece of yourself behind, another threshold has been broken.

As your $in[golden eyes] gaze turn the pitch black into silvery gray, you can&#39;t help but wonder how far will this path eventually take you.

$A[If I can call those wings at will... that could change many things...]

All of this time, your $A[sucubus hunger] has brought nothing but trouble. Now you are reaping rewards from it, though you don&#39;t yet know at what cost they&#39;ll come.

Lost in thought, you emerge at the end of the hallway and face a familiar door. $A[So this is where I am...]

Luckily for you, the metal door has a handle on this side. You push it open and emerge back into the familiar basement.

There is no one around, except for the wooden box with the creature inside. You carefully close the door again and straighten your $suit.

$A[So far so good...]

Now that you think about it, except for the Elder in the tower, no one else knows about your little adventure. You could play it off and just carry on with your day... or you could climb back into the tower and see where that gets you.

The thought is tempting.

$A[I&#39;d love to see the look on his face...]

You push the key in the lock and hear a loud *clang* as the mechanism turns inside. The door creeks open and you slip inside, climbing up the stone staricase.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/environments/attic_door.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; &gt;
Despite the complete darkness, you are able to see more this time - the dusty stone steps, as well as the deep scratches in them.

It&#39;s clear that something very heavy has been clawing its way up and down the tower many times. You trace one of the scratches with your finger - it cuts a few millimeters into the stone.

$A[Damn...]

Before you know it, you&#39;ve made your way up to the door at the top. You pause, wondering if you should knock or just barge in.

You push the door open and enter the tower. Your golden eyes turn the absolute darkness into a landscape of greys, allowing you to examine the room.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/elder.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot; &gt;
The tower&#39;s top is a large circular space, dominated by a massive throne of bones and skulls. The dead sockets seem to be staring at you somehow, making you feel uneasy. To your sides, you can see other piles of skulls, arranged in ominous shapes. In the center, there is a large circle with runes etched into the stone. The entire place feels otherworldly and radiates a presence of its own, as if projecting the power of all the slain foes.

$R[&#39;You agghain...?&#39;] A hiss descends from above, followed by a shadow dropping from the ceiling. The Elder stands in front of you, his glowing red eyes peering down. 

You take a step forward. You barely measure up to his massive chest. Your gaze turns up, meeting his without flinching.

$a[&#39;I know you can kill me. I&#39;m here because I&#39;m telling you the truth.&#39;]

The vampire remains still. $R[&#39;Hhow did you eschhaaape the pit?&#39;]

He raises an eyebrow. $R[&#39;You ahre not a normal succubhuss, girl... explain yourself.&#39;]

You take a step back, but now it&#39;s he who closes the distance, observing you intently. You were not expecting this to take a turn towards your peculiar situation this quickly, but it seems that the Elder is starting to put two and two together.

You sigh and bow your head. It seems that there&#39;s no getting out of it. Reluctantly, you tell the Elder you story, starting from the beginning.

After hearing your explanation, the creature finally breaks his gaze away from you and the tension disperses. The Elder sits on the throne, tapping his fingers on one of the skulls.

You go through the door and lead Vasil Petrescu down the corridor towards the gathering place. The half-human creature seems right at home walking down the dimly lit stone passages, his red eyes flaming as bright as the torches.

At the end of the corridor you come upon the heavy wooden door. There are still voices coming from inside. You are on time.

The Elder pushes ahead of you, flinging the door open.

$R[&#39;What were you dhoing up there, spider?&#39;]

$E[&#39;I was just observing, my lord!&#39;]

For the first time, you can hear panic in the black woman&#39;s voice. As the grip around her throat tightens, she turns her head towards you, giving you a pleading look. $E[&#39;The demon... she knows...&#39;]

The Elder loosens a bit, just enough to let her draw breath. $R[&#39;You tohld me she had jhoined Laviusss... Speak!&#39;]

As the Elder heads down towards the end of the hallway, you reach out a hand to Elise, helping her to get up.

$E[&#39;Thank you, tsk.&#39;]

The spider woman looks roughed-up, but she quickly recovers her smile. With a silent nod of agreement, the two of you follow a few paces behind the Elder vampire. You try to read her expression, but she seem impervious.

$A[I wonder what&#39;s going to happen now... will he spare Lavius? And the werewolf...?]

Your questions are about to be answered. With a fling, the Elder opens the iron door to the meeting chamber.

You cannot tell if he&#39;s enjoying himself or simply doesn&#39;t care. With a swing of his hand he grabs you by the hair and shoves your face to his crotch, sticking his member down your throat.

You begin to gag and struggle, but the Elder unceremoniously moves you bakc and forth, using virtually your entire body as a rag doll for his pleasure. His movements are fast, methodical, dispassionate. You can barely tell what&#39;s going on.

Before you know it, his giant member is stuck halfway down your throat and you struggle to breathe while he pumps down a torrent of sticky goo inside of you. You can almost feel it sliding all the way to your stomach and filling it with warmth.

He throws you away as unceremoniously as he had grabbed you, letting a thick stream drip out form your mouth.

Finally, Mihai leaves the room, swinging the door shut behind him. Now you can finally take a look at the room in front of you.

Why can&#39;t you just rest? Why can&#39;t you just be?

Your arms extend downwards, swishing with the waves. As if in a dream, you can see something red slipping out of your wrist. 

Someone is tugging at your back, trying to pull you out of the water. Your fingers are clumsily holding on to the red object, but it&#39;s slipping more and more.

$R[&#39;That foolh... Why whould he do such a thing?&#39;]

$a[&#39;He would do it for Narcissa,&#39;] you say quietly. $a[&#39;He may look like a flamboyant fool, but at heart he&#39;s a doomed lover. He wants to be with her somehow - and I guess Mihai is stopping him?&#39;] 

The Elder gives you a strange look. $a[&#39;I&#39;ll be honest, I haven&#39;t figured everything out yet - perhaps you&#39;ll know better than me. But I&#39;m sure that he is willing to do anything to be with her.&#39;] 

The Elder pauses for a moment. You can feel him considering your words. $R[&#39;She is a ghardian... that is why... But evhen if that wehre true... Lavhiouhs chould never accomplish anything alone...&#39;]

He seems lost in thought for a moment, his giant fingers rubbing his chin.

The Elder rubs his chin. $R[&#39;Her? Taking ordhers? Ha!&#39;]

$a[&#39;It&#39;s because Lavius has promised her a vessel for her offspring. She has been pestering Mihai for years to give her a victim to plant her eggs into, but he has always refused, so she&#39;s grown frustrated. It&#39;s the only reason she&#39;s helping Lavius now.&#39;]

The elder gives a bitter laugh. $R[&#39;That fhoolish son of mine... I&#39;ve alwhays told him to ghive her a maid or two, but he insists on dhoing things diffherenthly. HA!&#39;]

You give one last bow to the Elder and leave the tower, taking the staircase down towards the attic.

There isn&#39;t anyone around, so you descend back towards the reception. It&#39;s time to consider what to do next.

$a[&#39;Now, now, big guy... where were we exactly?&#39;] you step in closer, running a hand along his arm. Your devil&#39;s gown shifts in the light, enlarging your cleavage almost all the way to your nipples. You can see that the servan&#39;t face is getting ever so slightly red.

$a[&#39;**I** decide what we should and shouldn&#39;t, Ionut,&#39;] you say with a stern voice.

You reach in and take his misshapen cock out, bringing it to full erection with a few swift strokes. You can feel all the pent up frustration from the morning encounter as Ionut&#39;s member begins to throb helplessly under your touch.

You give him another handful of strokes, squeezing harder and harder, then stopping abruptly just as he&#39;s on the edge.

$Io[&#39;Agh, not again! Please, Miss Alexandara...&#39;]

You slide closer, putting your back against the servant&#39;s body. Even through the clothes, you can feel his large and irregular torso pressing agsint you. You can feel the bumps and stitches, the accelerated beating of his heart, and the growing bulge down there, just between your cheeks.

$a[&#39;Don&#39;t be shy now, Ionut,&#39;] you press mercilessly. $a[&#39;I seem to remember that you quite enjoyed... ALL of this.&#39;]

You take his hand and gently place it on your waist, slowly guiding it upwards until it cups your $breasts.

The bulge behind you starts throbbing and you press your ass even more firmly, slowly swaying your hips.

You pocket Ionut&#39;s keys and turn your attention to the pleading servant. You have to admit that it&#39;s a lot of fun to be in control and to make him do exactly as you wish.

You give him another hard, long stroke, feeling every curve and bump on his unnatural cock. Some might find it grotesque, but you have learned to enjoy it like a rare dish, an acquired $a[taste].

Some deeper instincts kick in and you accelerate the strokes, preparing your meal. Somehow, this feels right. Suddenly you become all too aware of your horns, they vibrate with a slight itch, a *tingle* on the top of your head. Your tummy gurgles, begging to be fed.

You squeeze Ionut hard and wrap your lips around the misshapen shaft, just in time to capture the hot load spurting out. As it oozes down your throat and into your tummy, you feel a pleasant warmth between your legs and a sense of *stasifaction*.

Something is happening.

The fire in your belly grows hotter and hotter. Something is driving you, no $a[forcing] you towards the edge, as if you&#39;re driving wildly towards the edge of a cliff, except that you&#39;re in the passenger seat and have no control.

Your legs inch a little farther apart, your juices flowing like the sacrificial blood of a lamb. The creature behind you is older, more powerful than anything you have ever met before. Images flood your mind of those terrible jaws locking between your legs and forcing you into forbidden delights. Why are all the skulls here? Who were they?

The bones rattle and you feel so, so small. So weak. So exposed. So owned.

$R[&#39;SUBMIT&#39;]

Despite your will or choice, your pussy quivers and convulses, spilling more juices on the floor. A powerful orgasm washes over you and you feel a bit of your power draining away. Countless bones rattle, as if applauding your performance. The skull&#39;s jaw closes and the glow slowly fades away.

You nod at the Elder and place the key in your pocket, before exiting the tower and making your way down the spiral staircase.

As soon as you&#39;re down to the attic, you take a deep breath and exhale, leaning against a nearby window.

There is light and colors again! You had not realized how long you had spent at the tower, and while your new vision allows you to see well enough in the dark, it&#39;s nice to be back outside. The memories of the tower feel almost surreal, like waking up from a dream.

He nods. $R[&#39;Evehry seven years, my subjects would send me a new wife... in exhchange for my protection...&#39;]

You look around at the piles and piles of skulls. 

$a[&#39;Every seven years... that means that you are... but what happened to the previous wife when you got a new one...&#39;]

A beautiful demon stares back at you, with $in[golden, cat-like eyes] popping out of the dull greyness of the room like shining jewels in a pile of mush.

You feel time slowing down and your heartbeat rings in your ears like the warbeat of a distant drum. You lean in closer, almost gluing yourself to the reflection. The intricate patterns of your irises seem to give off a soft sheen in the darkness, almost alive, flowing towards the center like golden sands pouring down the abyss of cosmic lust. 

Mesmerized, you watch them for a moment, before slowly moving back. It&#39;s hard to believe that the horned creature in the mirror really is you.

Your changes come with their own benefits, benefits that could help you gain control over the precarious situation that you&#39;ve found yourself in. But at the same time, they come at a cost.

$A[I should be careful with this... if I use my powers too much, I&#39;ll end up like a mindless sex toy...]

You feel your succubus powers surging and you give in to them. The darkness condenses around you and powerful wings propel you upwards, leaping through the air and freeing you from the predator&#39;s grasp. 

You manage to sustain the flight for only a handful of seconds, but it&#39;s enough. You land in another pile of trash and bones, which cushions your fall. 

As you lift your head up, the walls of the pit are much closer, and so is the door.

$A[I&#39;m almost there!!]

You scramble to get up, sending a skull bouncing down the pile and splashing into something. There is a sound of movement closing in on your new location, but you have enough of a head start.

You sprint through the decaying debris, abandoning stealth for speed. Now there&#39;s movement from other sides as well, coming towards you. You try to ignore it.

Now that $in[your eyes are fully adjusted to the dark], it&#39;s easier to navigate the pit without constantly slipping and tripping. You focus your efforts on a final sprint, climbing up the ridges of the pit, up and up towards $in[the door].

Finally, your fingers wrap around the metal rings of the door. It&#39;s made of heavy wood and reinforced with steel edges, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be locked. You push and one wing creaks open, just enough to allow you to slip into the hallway beyond.

You are in the dark void, numb and still. A part of you wonders if you&#39;re dead or dreaming, but even the question itself can&#39;t quite form itself properly in your mind.

Time passes, or at least you think it does. There&#39;s a faint feeling of cold, and a faint feeling of softness, but above all, there is stillness. Your body feels like it&#39;s made of clay, heavy and inert, every muscle having  completely forgotten that it ever had the ability to move.

Then a sensation of fullness begins to arise. It&#39;s small at first, just a ball in your belly, but it continues to grow. You can feel your body expanding, or rather being forced to expand. The fullness is starting to become heavy, uncomfortable. You want to fight it, but there&#39;s nothing you can do. You are completely $a[helpless].

Eventually, the growing stops, leaving you in a state of confused discomfort. Words and feelings scramble around your head, failing to form into cohesive thoughts. Eventually, you accept the new sensations and your mind is yet again lulled into the stillness of the void.

More time passes, or at least you think it does.

The floor underneath you is cold, but somehow soft.

Your body is aching.

Your breathing is difficult. But you are breathing.

You are alive.

Your fingers gently let go, letting the bracelet slide down your hand and towards the darkness beneath.

As you watch the last spots of crimson sink into the depths, there is a strange feeling of calm and acceptance that washes over you.

As you close your eyes, you feel a hand grabbing you from behind and pulling you out of the water, but the (link-reveal-goto:&quot;world already falls into darkness&quot;,&quot;Elise Epilogue drunk&quot;)[(set: $bracelet to 0)].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1826" name="Try to push the eggs out drunk" tags="cave" position="14836,7845" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt;

While Elise is fussing with the woman in the adjacent cavern, you try to get up and relieve at least some of the pressure.

$A[If I can get just one or two out while she isn&#39;t watching...]

The endeavour quickly proves to be more complicated than you imagined. Your belly is so round and heavy that even with your limbs free from the web, walking around requires a lot of effort.

With a lot of panting, you manage to roll to a corner of the cave and hide behind a rock, hoping that the spider woman won&#39;t notice what you&#39;re up to. With a grunt, you lift yourself up and squat, with your back against the stone.

You never imagined that your belly could be this full. You hold it with both hands out of fear that a sudden movement could send you tumbling over. It is deeply uncomfortable and yet perversely arousing. Like chains from within, the countless eggs stuffed inside you are keeping you slow and docile, doing whatever the black woman wants of you.

In the distance, you can hear the muffled screams of the other woman. A nameless victim of the spider queen, you can only imagine what horrors she&#39;s experiencing, all the while being driven to the edge of ecstasy. The thought provokes a sudden heat in your own belly and you feel the warm juices dripping down your thighs.

$A[Come on, Alex, get a grip...]

You desperately need *some* sort of relief. Your mind and body are on the very edge, you can feel it. Even a single egg out would help you to think clearer, to move just a little more freely. You decide to give it a go.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Push an egg out-&gt;Push an egg out drunk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1827" name="Push an egg out drunk" tags="cave" position="14964,7847" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt;

You grit your teeth and give the push a go. There is a deep rumbling inside your tummy and you feel something shifting inside you, ever so slowly.

You take a quick gasp for air and continue pushing. Your body feels heavy and the increasing pressure is making your head spin. 

$A[Come on, you can do this Alex...]

You try to focus on the goal but it&#39;s so damn hard. Despite all of your efforts the eggs is barely moving forward. You can feel it inside of your guts but it seems almost an impossible task to get it out.

You want to give up and just lie down. It would be so much easier than this. The fullness of your belly is somehow inviting, placating.

By sheer force of will, you chase the thought away and decide to continue trying.

You try again, with even more effort, and this time you can feel some result. Painfully slowly, you can feel an egg moving further and further down your rectum and beginning to push against the inner walls of your back entrance.

$A[Dammit... how big is this thing... ?!]

You pant and push and pant again, gaining painful millimiter after painful millimeter while your hole ever so slowly begins to stretch open.

At every moment you can swear that your body can&#39;t take it anymore, and at every moment you decide to push it a step further. Your hands press down on your bloated belly, hoping that the additional pressure will help expell out at least one of the ticking time bombs.

With great resistance and against all odds, your hole stretches wider and wider as the egg inches forward. You can feel part of it beginning to show itself out, but much of it is still inside. The shell is rough and irregular and covered in something sticky that is somehow making everything even more difficult.

You can feel that maybe a third of it is already out, though your progress is becoming increasingly difficult. You begin to wonder if it&#39;s even physically possible to get it out.

But you are so close. You refuse to give up. Your head is spinning and your body is trembling but you simply refuse to give up.

You take a deep breath and push one final time. Your eyes close and your entire body is contracting, expelling the egg bit after bit.

You feel that you can&#39;t take it any more. Your hole is stretched to its absolute limit, gaping wide. You can see almost half of the egg sticking out now, but you simply have no strength left. Your muscles feel weak and shaking.

You take a deep breath, trying to gather some force.

$E[&#39;What do we have here, tsk?&#39;]

A black face hangs down from the ceiling, right in front of you and your heart stops for a second.

As Elise slides down and examines the scene you can feel a clear air of dissatisfaction in her expression.

$E[&#39;Tsk, tsk. What are you doing, girl? Are you trying to get rid of my children?&#39;] She places a loving hand on your bloated tummy, caressing it gently.

$a[&#39;It was- it was becoming too much, I need to remove at least one, I was going to burst...&#39;] Your voice fades off into an uncertain whisper.

$E[&#39;Now, now, girl,&#39;] the hand slides down your tummy and between your legs, rubbing the wetness of your slit. $E[&#39;I expected more obedience from you.&#39;]

The black woman puts her hand on the egg that is halfway out, stuck in your stretched asshole. She looks at you and gives you an evil grin.

$a[&#39;Please,&#39;] you whimper quietly. $a[&#39;Please, Elise, no. I can&#39;t.&#39;]

A tear rolls down your cheek as you frantically shake your head.

The egg begins to inch backwards, undoing your hard earned progress. You can feel the other eggs resisting. Everything is packed so tightly in your bowels that any movement causes a chain reaction, shifting things around with the slow and excruciating pace of a glacier.

$a[&#39;Please, no, no no, I can&#39;t, I&#39;m going to burst...&#39;]

You cry out in pain and desperation as the tears begin to swell your eyes.

$E[&#39;Hush now, girl, don&#39;t be a fuss!&#39;]

A black hand squeezes your mouth and forces you to look up at your mistress. $E[&#39;You brought this upon yourself, tsk. If you had stayed put, things would have been easier. Now shut up and take it.&#39;]

Elise shoves the egg forcefully and in an instant everything is lost. It slides back past your entrance and your tormented hole closes around it, sending the egg even deeper. You moan painfully as the backed up line of bulbs is forced deeper again, causing your tummy to throb and inflate.

$E[&#39;There, that wasn&#39;t so hard now, was it?&#39;] The black woman pats you on the head and you collapse down, holding your heavy bloated tummy, all hope dead and buried. $E[&#39;And from the looks of things, you even enjoyed it a little, tsk.&#39;] Elise runs a finger between your folds and then lifts it up to your face, revealing a line of thick juice. $E[&#39;Let&#39;s get you back to your bed, tsk.&#39;]

With great effort, you force your eyes to open. Around you, there is darkness and stone, and lots of silk.

$E[&#39;Is my pet awake yet?&#39;] comes a voice from above. 

You lift your head to see Elise, hanging from the ceiling on top of you, her green unblinking eyes staring down with cold amusement. She drops down next to you, black skin contrasting on the white silk all around.

$E[&#39;How are you feeling, girl?&#39;]

You consider the question for a long moment, then slowly move your gaze from the spider woman down to your body. You are lying on the floor of a large cavern, naked save for a handful of webs half-wrapped around your torso. Everything feels so heavy. Your belly is giant and bloated, bulging outwards like a pregnant woman that is just about ready to give birth. Your breasts are also round and tender, pushed up by the uncomfortable fullness inside you.

Memories slowly drip to your consciousness. The conspiracy. The Elder. The song.

Your eyes dart to your wrist, but there&#39;s nothing there. Reality begins to set in, and so does panic.

It&#39;s reassuring, even $a[natural]. You vaguely remember a time when your body felt different, but the memory struggles to stay in focus in your mind.

$E[&#39;Gather your strength, dear. You&#39;ll need it.&#39;]

You let yourself drift into the warm, silky feeling, finding an uneasy sleep permeated by vague shadows and distant terrors. Time passes, or at least you think it does.

You feel the touch of warm skin against your body, pulling you out of your slumber. You open your eyes to see the face of a young woman, lying next to you. She looks vaguely familiar, though you can&#39;t quite put your finger on it.

For a moment you wonder if you&#39;re still dreaming and if she&#39;s really there, but then you see Elise looming behind her. Your mind snaps back into focus.

$a[&#39;What&#39;s going on? Who is she...?&#39;]

$E[&#39;She&#39;s no one, tsk. Now hold her.&#39;]

Elise pushes the unconscious woman towards you and you instinctively take her in your arms. Her naked body presses against yours and she makes a small movement, settling into an almost lover&#39;s embrace.

The spider woman lowers herself behind the newcomer and you suddenly realize exactly what&#39;s going to happen. You can see the moment when the woman&#39;s expression winces into discomfort as the ovipositor slides inside her and the first egg begins its journey.

$a[&#39;W-what do you want me to do?&#39;] you ask with increasing urgency. The woman in your arms is beginning to twitch and stir, her chest rising more quickly with every egg that slides inside of her. You can tell that she&#39;s going to wake up soon.

$E[&#39;You wanted to be my servant, didn&#39;t you? So serve me, girl. You know what to do - just follow your instincts. Soothe her, keep her docile and happy. You know how I like it, tsk.&#39;]

You look at the black woman&#39;s round green eyes and then back at the girl in your arms. She&#39;s young, perhaps in her early twenties. Her complexion reminds you of the people from the village, fair skin and dark hair falling over her full breasts. Under her eyelids you can see her eyes moving faster and faster, as if caught in a bad dream. 

The girl twitches again, and suddenly her eyes open, locking into yours. You can see fear, confusion, surprise and arousal. While the two of you are exchanging glances, another bulge slips into her tummy, forcing a groan out of her. As if taken aback by her own reaction, the girl looks down at herself. Her breasts are resting on yours so she probably can&#39;t see much, but you have no doubt that a million thoughts are going through her head.

$a[&#39;It&#39;s alright,&#39;] you whisper quietly. $a[&#39;Everything will be alright.&#39;]

The girl looks at you with increasing confusion and you run a hand through her hair, trying to calm her.

&#39;What&#39;s going on...&#39; she mutters. Her voice is weak and distant and for a moment you feel sorry for her.

$a[&#39;Hush now, love. There&#39;s nothing to worry about.&#39;]

Another egg slides inside the girl and you can feel her full belly twitch, skin pressed against yours, the numerous bulbs pressing from inside and shifting a little to make space for the new ones.

&#39;What&#39;s happening to me, where am I...?&#39;

There is rising concern in her voice. Sluggishly, she moves her hands down her body, starting to get a feel for her giant bulge. You can see panic rising in her eyes.

$a[&#39;There&#39;s nothing to worry about. Look at me.&#39;] You push her chin up, forcing her eyes to lock into yours again.

You grab her face in your hands and pull her towards you, planting a kiss on her lips. 

The girl is reluctant at first, trying to push you away, but as another egg slips inside her you can feel a wave of relaxation wash over her muscles. Her mouth gives in, opening for a deeper kiss that tastes of of wine and something stronger.

$A[Did Elise pick her up from the inn...? Are we even near the village...?]

There are questions bubbling in your mind, but you push them away, focusing on the present. The girl&#39;s naked body feels soft and warm against yours and her kisses bring back distant memories of lust and love.

After a long moment the girl moves her head back and gazes into your eyes. You can see the veil of confusion has already fallen over her. There is a distinct $in[sheen] in her eyes, drool sliding down her chin and sweat covering her skin. Her breathing is quick and shallow, following the pace of the eggs being pumped into her belly. You can feel her expanding in front of your eyes, overwhelmed by madness and pleasure.

$a[&#39;Don&#39;t worry,&#39;] you whisper quietly, pulling her head in your arms. She smells bittersweet, with an air of freshness in her hair, telling you that she hasn&#39;t been in the damp cave for long. 

The girl seems a bit bewildered by your action, but doesn&#39;t resist much. As you wrap around her you can feel her warm boddy shivering, a tension rising and falling with every egg being pushed inside of her. 

&#39;What&#39;s going on...?&#39; she mutters in your ear. Her voice is weak and distant and for a moment you feel sorry for her.

$a[&#39;There&#39;s nothing to worry about. Just hold tight,&#39;] you say reassuringly, squeezing her harder towards you. 

She meekly tries to push you away, struggling to look around, though her efforts remain half-hearted, as if she&#39;s not sure if she wants to resist or give in to the sensations.

You take the girl&#39;s hands and place them on your breasts. She gives them a squeeze and lowers her head between them, kissing the soft skin and sucking on your erect nipples.

$a[&#39;Aaah~&#39;]

You let yourself fall into her caresses this time, fingers digging into her hair as she kisses her way from your chest up to your neck and finds your lips again, diving in even more passionately than before.

The drool from your kisses drips in the space between your breasts and hers, all the way down, lubricating your round and bloated tummies rubbing against one another.

With every moan and squirm, you can feel the girl&#39;s fate being sealed, her mind drowned in the ecstasy of the moment. And despite all sense and rationality, all you can feel is a deep, unbearable, unrelenting and unashamed arousal. 

You run a hand on her bloated belly and you can feel an almost orgasmic sensation. You know exactly what is going to happen to this poor girl and it&#39;s driving you insane. Your hand moves even lower, slipping between her legs and beginning to rub her slit, already flowing with juices.

The girl lifts her head again and for a brief moment, the veil of lust is pierced and a shadow washes over her face.

$a[&#39;It&#39;s okay, don&#39;t worry... there, you&#39;re such a brave girl...&#39;] 

You reassure her repeatedly, pulling her back into your embrace and making sure that she doesn&#39;t look at the black creature hunched right behind her.

&#39;I&#39;m scared&#39;, she whimpers, and this time it&#39;s her clenching around you.

$a[&#39;There, there, you&#39;re a good girl, you can take this...&#39;]

You reach your arms around her and grab her ass with both hands, speading it apart. You can feel the moment when Elise&#39;s ovipositor sinks even deeper. The girl moans and her nails dig into your skin. You can feel her belly, firmly pressed against yours, getting rounder and rounder.

A wicked grin plays on your lips. $a[&#39;There&#39;s a good slut, just take them all...&#39;]

You can tell when the moment of realisation hits her and the girl violently pushes away, trying to free herself.

&#39;No, stop! What&#39;s going?! I don&#39;t want this! Someone, help!&#39; She leaps up, jerking out of your arms. The ovipositors slides out of her and a few eggs are expelled, plopping in a slimy puddle on the ground.

$E[&#39;Tsk. What a mess.&#39;]

The girl turns around and screams, seeing the giant spider behind her. You hadn&#39;t realized when Elise&#39;s veil of illusion was broken. The air shifts around her and in a long instant she is the black woman again, staring disapprovingly at her young victim and yourself. The bite kisses her neck swiftly and she collapses down at the ground, unconscious.

$E[&#39;You shouldn&#39;t get so carried away, girl. Keep them docile and calm and leave the rest to me, tsk. Now this one is ruined.&#39;]

$a[&#39;What do you mean, &quot;ruined&quot;?&#39;] you ask, looking at the girl&#39;s bloated body lying on the web next to you. $a[&#39;She&#39;s completely full with your eggs. Isn&#39;t that what you wanted?&#39;]

$a[&#39;Daughers?&#39;]

$E[&#39;Others like me. Intelligent. Resourceful. Powerful.&#39;]

Elise has almost finished with the top part of the girl, weaving the beginning of a white coccoon. You can see the girl twitching underneath, her arms and legs making small eratic movements, as if caught in a bad dream.

$a[&#39;I&#39;m still not sure I understand...&#39;]

Elise rolls the body closer to you, ignoring your question. $E[&#39;What do you think, where should her hands go, tsk?&#39;]

You look at the helpless girl, considering the implications of your choice.

You take the girl&#39;s hands and place them behind her back as Elise begins to wrap another layer of white silk around her. You only need to hold them for a while until the web takes hold and the girl is locked in an utterly defenceless position.

$A[Why am I such a terrible person...]

In her nightmarish sleep, the girl will feel the total loss of control and the complete helplessness as her body is taken for the spider&#39;s sinister purposes. You know that she&#39;s doomed now, and yet you can&#39;t help offering her this final gift of lustful insanity. In many ways, you know exactly how she feels. 

As you feel a thin line of juices drip down your thighs, you begin to wonder if you&#39;re not doing to her exactly what you want done to yourself. The $a[haze] in your mind rises like a fine mist and your heart pounds faster while the spider woman finished her work.

Eventually, the girl is completely wrapped in a white coccoon, with her hands firmly locked behind her back. There&#39;s only a hole left around her mouth and nose, allowing the victim just enough access to air to stay alive. Elise pushes her in your arms again and positions herself on the other side, tearing another small hole in the web just between her legs.

$E[&#39;Hold her steady now, girl...&#39;]

You can&#39;t see very well, but it seems like there&#39;s something $E[different] entering the girl this time. Instead of the thick ovipositor, this time it&#39;s a longer and thinner tube. 

Your vision shifts, the image alternating between a smiling black woman and a giant black spider, body wrapped around the helpless victim. Even through the layers of silk, you can feel the girl&#39;s curves and the tiny movements of her body as Elise begins to fill her again. 

The scene is an example of perfect $a[submission], and is overwhelmingly hot. You feel a burning sensation in your own bloated belly and the urge becomes irresitible.

In her nightmarish sleep, the girl will feel all the movements of the bumps inside of her as they slowly grow and develop. You know that she&#39;s doomed now, and yet you can&#39;t help offering her this final gift of lustful insanity. In many ways, you know exactly how she feels.

Your hand slides between your legs and you begin to rub your wet slit, eyes locked on the coccooned girl next to you. 

You can almost feel the viscous liquid being injected inside of her, permeating her body, filling every gap of space between and around the slimy eggs stashed in her belly.

It&#39;s hard to tell if the girl is awake or asleep, but you follow with a thirsty gaze every one of her tiny movements - every gasp, every pant and grunt, every turn and twist of her body, every twitch of her muscles. You can feel her stretching and expanding to the very brim and then a step more.

After a long minute, the process is finally complete and Elise slides out of the girl, sealing the space between her legs with a fresh sheet of silk.

$E[&#39;I suppose this will do, for now. Tsk, tsk. But try to do better with the next one.&#39;]

$a[&#39;You mentioned something about wanting daughters, right? I&#39;m not sure I understand how everything fits together...&#39;]

Elise sighs, giving you the quivalent of an eye roll, if spiders could roll their eyes.

$E[&#39;If I fertilize my own eggs, I can only get lowly workers, tsk. They are good for keeping the lair, but not much for expanding the family.&#39;]

$a[&#39;So what do you need then? Someone else?&#39;]

Elise&#39;s black limbs continue to work, rolling the tied girl into a thicker and thicker coccoon.

$E[&#39;I need a willing vessel. Someone who understands... and accepts... and invites... the consequences.&#39;]

$a[&#39;That&#39;s - that&#39;s really odd. How does that even work? I mean-&#39;]

$E[&#39;It&#39;s the curse of Ariadne,&#39;] interrupts you Elise. $E[&#39;It&#39;s why there are so few of my kind.&#39;] Elise falls silent for a moment, then turns to you.$E[&#39;I was born after a German prince fell in love with my mother, four centuries ago. She asked him to remain pure for a month and meet her at night in the nearby forest. They escaped to her cave, where they made love and then, before he could finish, she pinned him down and filled his belly with her spawn.&#39;]

$a[&#39;That- must have been quite the surprise...&#39;]

$E[&#39;You would be surprised what men would go with in the heat of the moment, tsk.&#39;] chuckles Elise. $E[&#39;She strung him naked from the ceiling and told him that in a weeks time he&#39;d be free to go, if he still wished it. Bloated and quivering with frustration, his mind quickly sank into madness. By the end of the second day he sang praises for his mistress, by the fourth he was begging and whimpering, ready to do anything for her. So my father said the words willingly, and was rewarded with bliss. For a while. Tsk tsk.]

You shiver at the sinister implication and look down at your own bloated tummy, wondering if you&#39;ll end the same. Then you look at the the now fully complete coccoon, barely recognizible as the woman you held not so long ago.

You want to say something back, but the spider woman&#39;s attention has shifted entirely to her new prize. She lifts the wrapped victim up in the air and scuttles away to an adjacent part of the cavern.

For a moment, you are left alone.

You continue rubbing her slit and the girl slowly relaxes again, giving in to your affections. You pull her back into your embrace, making sure that she can&#39;t see the creature hunched right behind her.

&#39;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready&#39;, she whimpers. &#39;Aaah~&#39;

Your fingers plunge deeper into her folds and your movements accelerate, making the girl moan and cling to you helplessly while the eggs continue to be pushed inside of her. $a[&#39;There, there, you&#39;re a good girl, you can take it...&#39;]

For some reason her docile acceptance is only fueling your arousal. You double down on your efforts, stealing louder and louder moans and whimpers from the girl in your arms. $a[&#39;Take it, dear, take it **ALL**...&#39;]

Elise continues her sinister work, stuffing the girl more and more while you play around and tease her. She&#39;s now almost as round and immobile as you are, her slender body completely transformed by the spider.

$E[&#39;Make her give in willingly,&#39;] hisses Elise from above. $E[&#39;Make her say it out loud!&#39;]

&#39;What was that?&#39; asks the girl in a slow and absent way, her voice barely a whisper in your ear. As you lift her face up, you can see in her eyes that she&#39;s already gone, her mind plunged too far into the haze of lust and madness.

$a[&#39;Don&#39;t you worry about a thing, dear.&#39;]

The girl gives you a small nod and smiles. &#39;If you say so... I trust you...&#39;

Your fingers push inside her pussy and she gasps, mouth drooling like a bitch in heat.

You continue rubbing her slit as you see her struggle to overcome confusion and make sense of what you just said to her. Her head slowly starts to turn back, trying to catch a glimpse of where the eggs are coming from, but you pull her back into your embrace, making sure that she can&#39;t see the creature hunched right behind her.

&#39;I&#39;m scared&#39;, she whimpers. &#39;I don&#39;t want this..&#39;

$a[&#39;There, there, you&#39;re a good girl, you can take it...&#39;]

For some reason her fear is only fueling your arousal. You plunge your fingers all the way into her pussy, stealing more moans and whimpers from the girl. $a[&#39;Take it, dear, take it **ALL**...&#39;]

In an instant, you reach your arms around her and grab her ass with both hands, speading it apart. Her flesh gives in, the girl screams and you can feel the exact moment when Elise&#39;s ovipositor sinks even deeper into her ass. The girl&#39;s nails dig into your skin. You can feel her belly, firmly pressed against yours, getting rounder and rounder.

A wicked grin plays on your lips. $a[&#39;There&#39;s a good slut, you will become a wonderful vessel...&#39;]

Suddenly realisation hits her and the girl violently pushes away, trying to free herself.

&#39;No, stop! What&#39;s going?! I don&#39;t want this! Someone, help!&#39; She leaps up, jerking out of your arms. The ovipositors slides out of her and a few eggs are expelled, plopping in a slimy puddle on the ground.

$E[&#39;Tsk. What a mess.&#39;]

The girl turns around and gives a high-pitched scream, seeing the giant spider behind her. You hadn&#39;t realized when Elise&#39;s veil of illusion was broken. The air shifts around her and in a long instant she is the black woman again, staring disapprovingly at her young victim and yourself. The bite kisses her neck swiftly and she collapses down at the ground, unconscious.

$E[&#39;You shouldn&#39;t get so carried away, girl. Keep them docile and calm and leave the rest to me, tsk. Now this one is ruined.&#39;]

$a[&#39;All you have to do is give in,&#39;] you say, fingers plunging deeper and deeper inside of her.

&#39;Aaaahh~&#39;

$a[&#39;Say it!&#39;]

&#39;Aah! I give in~&#39;

$a[&#39;Do you want to be a mommy?&#39;] you ask, caressing her round and heavy belly, glistening wet from her drool. $a[&#39;Do you want to give your body in service of your mistress?&#39;] Your fingers accelerate more and more, going in and out of the poor wreck and rubbing her slit mercilessly.

&#39;Yes, I do! I do!&#39;

You can feel her tensing up, climbing closer and closer to the edge. She&#39;s almost there, pushed into insanity by your caresses and the ovipositor filling her guts to the brim. 

You catch her pace and let her climb higher and higher, leading up to the brink of her climax. $a[&#39;Say it! Pledge it out loud!&#39;]

&#39;Aaah! I give my body! I give everything!Aaaah~~ Please use me!&#39;

The girl climaxes, her eyes rolling and entire body shaking and shivering. For a brief moment, you see a strange symbol appear on her belly, before fading away.

$E[&#39;Excellent, tsk. Job well done, my pet.&#39;]

Elise&#39;s fangs kiss the girl&#39;s neck and she collapses, her previous euphoria reduced to small twitching movements of her naked body. You look at her, not fully comprehending what had just happened.

$a[&#39;What was that thing... what happened to her?&#39;] you ask, looking at the girl&#39;s bloated body lying on the web next to you. 

$E[&#39;She gave herself willingly, which means that she will give me a daughter, tsk. Just as I had hoped.&#39;] replies Elise, her black hands already wrapping a white sheet around the naked skin.

$a[&#39;A daughter?&#39;]

$E[&#39;Another like me. Intelligent. Resourceful. Powerful.&#39;]

$a[&#39;I&#39;m still not sure I understand... aren&#39;t you the one controlling everything? You could have filled her with your eggs either way.&#39;]

$E[&#39;It isn&#39;t that simple, tsk.&#39;] Elise has almost finished with the top part of the girl, weaving the beginning of a white coccoon. You can see the girl twitching underneath, her arms and legs making small eratic movements, as if caught in a bad dream. $E[&#39;I can fill her with eggs and make workers, yes. But I can make plenty of those, now that Mihai&#39;s not around. A **daughter** is different.]

You take the girl&#39;s hands and place them behind her back as Elise begins to wrap another layer of white silk around her. You only need to hold them for a while until the web takes hold and the girl is locked in an utterly defenceless position.

$A[Why am I such a terrible person...]

In her nightmarish sleep, the girl will feel the total loss of control and the complete helplessness as her body is taken for the spider&#39;s sinister purposes. You know that she&#39;s doomed now, and yet you can&#39;t help offering her this final gift of lustful insanity. In many ways, you know exactly how she feels. 

As you feel a thin line of juices drip down your thighs, you begin to wonder if you&#39;re not doing to her exactly what you want done to yourself. The $a[haze] in your mind rises like a fine mist and your heart pounds faster while the spider woman finished her work.

Eventually, the girl is completely wrapped in a white coccoon, with her hands firmly locked behind her back. There&#39;s only a hole left around her mouth and nose, allowing the victim just enough access to air to stay alive. Elise pushes her in your arms again and positions herself on the other side, tearing another small hole in the web just between her legs.

$E[&#39;Hold her steady now, girl...&#39;]

You can&#39;t see very well, but it seems like there&#39;s something $E[different] entering the girl this time. Instead of the thick ovipositor, this time it&#39;s a longer and thinner tube. 

Your vision shifts, the image alternating between a smiling black woman and a giant black spider, body wrapped around the helpless victim. Even through the layers of silk, you can feel the girl&#39;s curves and the tiny movements of her body as Elise begins to fill her again. 

The scene is an example of perfect $a[submission], and is overwhelmingly hot. You feel a burning sensation in your own bloated belly and the urge becomes irresitible.

You take the girl&#39;s hands and place them on her inflated belly as Elise begins to wrap another layer of white silk around her. You carefully adjust her palms so they are pressed down flat against her skin. 

$A[Why am I such a terrible person...]

In her nightmarish sleep, the girl will feel all the movements inside of her as the new creature slowly grows and develops. You know that she&#39;s doomed now, and yet you can&#39;t help offering her this final gift of lustful insanity. In many ways, you know exactly how she feels.

$a[&#39;What makes a daughter different? I&#39;m not sure I understand how everything fits together...&#39;]

Elise sighs, giving you the quivalent of an eye roll, if spiders could roll their eyes.

$E[&#39;If I had fertilized my own eggs, I would only get lowly workers, tsk. They are good for keeping the lair, but not much for expanding the family.&#39;]

$a[&#39;But since she climaxed, she fertilized them herself? That doesn&#39;t make sense...&#39;]

$E[&#39;It&#39;s not that she climaxed, tsk. She became a willing vessel. She said the words and invited the consequences. This changes everything.&#39;]

$a[&#39;That&#39;s - that&#39;s really odd. How does that even work? I mean-&#39;]

$E[&#39;It&#39;s the curse of Ariadne,&#39;] interrupts you Elise. $E[&#39;It&#39;s why there are so few of my kind.&#39;] Elise falls silent for a moment, then turns to you. $E[&#39;I was born after a German prince fell in love with my mother, four centuries ago. She asked him to remain pure for a month and meet her at night in the nearby forest. They escaped to her cave, where they made love and then, before he could finish, she pinned him down and filled his belly with her spawn.&#39;]

$a[&#39;That- must have been quite the surprise...&#39;]

$E[&#39;You would be surprised what men would go with in the heat of the moment, tsk.&#39;] chuckles Elise. $E[&#39;She strung him naked from the ceiling and told him that in a weeks time he&#39;d be free to go, if he still wished it. Bloated and quivering with frustration, his mind quickly sank into madness. By the end of the second day he sang praises for his mistress, by the fourth he was begging and whimpering, ready to do anything for her. So my father said the words willingly, and was rewarded with bliss. For a while. Tsk tsk.]

You shiver at the sinister implication and look down at your own bloated tummy, wondering if you&#39;ll end the same. Then you look at the the girl, realizing what you had just done.

Elise rolls the body closer to you. $E[&#39;What do you think, where should her hands go, tsk?&#39;]

Your hand slides between your legs and you begin to rub your wet slit, eyes locked on the coccooned girl next to you. 

You can almost feel the viscous liquid being injected inside of her, permeating her body, filling every gap of space between and around the slimy eggs stashed in her belly.

It&#39;s hard to tell if the girl is awake or asleep, but you follow with a thirsty gaze every one of her tiny movements - every gasp, every pant and grunt, every turn and twist of her body, every twitch of her muscles. You can feel her stretching and expanding to the very brim and then a step more.

(if: $victimHands is &quot;belly&quot;)[You can feel the girl&#39;s hands grasping at her belly as if trying to press down and prevent the inevitable expansion, to no avail.](else:)[You can tell how the girl is struggling, half conscious, to free her hands from behind her back, only to realize that they can barely bulge an inch.]

After a long minute, the process is finally complete and Elise slides out of the girl, sealing the space between her legs with a fresh sheet of silk.

$E[&#39;I suppose this will do, for now. Tsk, tsk. You have fulfilled your job well, my pet. You can rest now.&#39;]

Feelings of guilt and lust was over you, but the haze of your own mind is too great to properly consider them. You look at the fresh coccoon.

You want to say something back, but the spider woman&#39;s attention has shifted entirely to her new prize. She lifts the wrapped victim up in the air and scuttles away to an adjacent part of the cavern.

For a moment, you are left alone.

Your head is spinning and your vision is blurry as you find yourself back into the same spot where you woke up, the white silk welcoming your body into its warm and comforting embrace.

The black woman looks down upon you, though you can&#39;t quite read her expression.

You look around the spacious cavern, covered with cobwebs and strange markings on the walls. The image of the helpless girl is is still fresh in your mind, though also somehow distant and surreal. 

You can&#39;t quite tell if a minute or an hour has passed.

$A[Damn, this doesn&#39;t feel real...]

Now more than ever, your mind is swimming in a haze of lust and confusion. A part of you knows that what&#39;s happening is very dangerous and likely to end badly. You know, rationally, that you should be absolutely $in[terrified], especially now that you don&#39;t have the bracelet on your wrist. And despite this rational understanding, you find it so hard to be worried.

Your body feels comfortably uncomfortable - round, bloated and docile. The pressure is both stifling and somehow exciting. The taste of the girl is still on your lips and thinking about all the eggs in her belly is only plunging you deeper into the ecstatic haze of madness and pleasure.

$A[I need to get a grip, now!] With your last remaining willpower, you try to focus. $A[Argh, why is it so hard to think?!] You realize that it&#39;s the pressure. It&#39;s the damned pressure that&#39;s making it hard to think, to breathe, to move, to act. Both your body and mind are incapacitated by it.

You look around - Elise seems to be nowhere to be seen, probably still busy with her new victim. Now would be your only chance to do anything.

You open your eyes and see a familiar black face staring down at you. You try to pull yourself up to sit, but find that even more difficult than before. Your body has somehow become even heavier and even less mobile.

$a[&#39;How much time...&#39;]

Elise gets on top of you, pinning your hands to the side. You look at the the black woman&#39;s green spectacles. She grins at you.and your vision begins to shift and dance as the veil of illusion melts away. Then you see her.

Elise, the giant spider, is looming above you. You can barely move, let alone resist in any meaningful way. You have nowhere to go. You have nothing to do. You know exactly what&#39;s coming.

The power surges through your body, amplified tenfold. Every muscle that you have contracts in agony and yet you scream in pleasure, squirting out a jet of liquid on the chair underneath you.

Moving on to your face, it is also somewhat different - you still have $hair, $eyes, soft white skin and $lips, but your features have changed. It&#39;s subtle, but it&#39;s there. You are $A[devilishly gorgeous]. 

On your chest, you can&#39;t really tell if your $breasts are the same, but they feel perhaps a little bigger and softer.

At this point you know that whatever you do would be totally useless. You spread your legs apart, opening your holes for her.

A thin tube extends from her abdomen and pushes against your asshole, sliding in easily. You can feel it penetrating deeper and deeper until it&#39;s all the way in your guts.

Then, the liquid starts injecting.

Being already as round and bloated as you are, you thought that it couldn&#39;t get much worse. You were wrong. The thick, viscous stream is forced into you, filling every millimeter of space between the bulbs and making your belly stretch outward even more. You can feel the pressure into your entire body, pushing and compressing organs aside. Your lungs are shoved from within, making your breathing difficult and shallow. 

Your head is spinning. Euphoria and madness is washing over you on hot and cold waves, your heart pumping a million miles an hour. You gasp and moan as your body is stretched to the very brink of all physical limits, forced into a grotesque exaggeration of its feminine form.

After a long moment, the process is finally complete. Elise slowly pulls out of you, leaving a last spurt of special liquid, sticky and thick, which seals your entrance for good. You are left laying on your back and gazing at the monstrosity above you, with all of its eggs fimly implanted inside of you.

$E[&#39;So what will it be, dear?&#39;] asks Elise, running a black leg along your wet slit. $E[&#39;Will you give me a parting present of a daughter?&#39;] She teases your clit, stealing a humiliating moan from you. $E[&#39;If it&#39;s all the same to you, why not be a good girl and make yourself useful?

With your legs up in the air and nowhere to go, the humiliating feeling of defeat washes over you. You know that this is the end, so why not indulge in the forbidden pleasures that the creature is offering you?

$a[&#39;Fine, I&#39;ll do it..&#39;] you whimper.

$E[&#39;Excellent. I knew you were a good find, tsk.&#39;]

Elise continues caressing your slit, her black spider legs showing surprising delicacy and dexterity. She gently pulls your folds to the side, exposing the aroused bud that is your clit.

$E[&#39;Such a pretty sight... Now, girl, tell me that you want it...&#39;]

$a[&#39;Please... I&#39;m so close...&#39;]

$E[&#39;Not yet, tsk. Tell me you&#39;ll carry my daughter.&#39;]

The helplessness washes over you. You feel small and cornered and alone. Your pussy twitches, close to an orgasm.

$a[&#39;I&#39;ll do it! I&#39;ll be your vessel! I accept willingly!&#39;]

Elise&#39;s pace accelerates and you can see the same strange symbol beginning to glow over your tummy. Before you can focus on it, your frail consciousness is pushed over the edge and your entire body shakes into a powerful orgasm.

Waves of pleasure and bliss wash over you again and again as you keep shivering. You can feel something inside you changing. You are scared. You are terrified. A second orgasm follows the first.

$a[&#39;No...&#39;] you whisper, gasping for air. $a[&#39;This is not what I wanted, Elise... you betrayed me... I will not give you this pleasure...&#39;]

You try to sound defiant, but even in your own ears your voice appears weak and defeated.

$E[&#39;Such a disappointment, tsk. I thought we would go far, you and I. Shame. Are you sure you don&#39;t want to reconsider, girl? Things could be much worse for you, you know...&#39;]

You give a small, bitter laugh. $a[&#39;You&#39;ve already taken everything, Elise...&#39;]

$E[&#39;Tsk! You insolent whore! do you know how long I&#39;ve waited for this?&#39;] She pulls your hair back, forcing you o stare right into her maw, fangs twitching angrily. $E[&#39;Very well, if this is your choice...&#39;]

The fangs approach and you feel another bite on your neck, this time with the full fury of the eight-legged creature. Your body shakes violently and the world begins to fade.

The touch intensifies and soon enough you find yourself climbing towards an orgasm, then another one. Time stretches and your consciousness recedes back to void, capitulating to incessent waves of bliss and pleasure.

The touch returns again and soon enough you find yourself climbing towards an climax, only to be left abruptly before the finish.

The Elder runs a hand down your spine, almost like a greeting. His fingers are carefully exploring the cruvature of your body, with long sharp nails making your hairs stand on edge.

As he moves down he grabs your hips and pulls you in closer, making full contact with your skin. You can feel his giant muscular body pressing against your back, his cold breath right over your head. Your wet slit is already quivering with anticipation.

$A[I&#39;ve never felt anything like this before...]

He squeezes your cheeks, spreading them apart and moving your legs into position. For a long moment, you can feel your hole stretching and gaping, ready and drooling for him.

Then, his member presses agaisnt you and a measured touch at the back of your neck gives you his next silent command.

&lt;div class=&quot;two_column_grid&quot; style=&quot;--small-col:1fr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The first thrust comes slow and steady, pushing in all of his length inside of you. He feels somehow even bigger than you expected and you can feel your pussy stretching in all directions to accommodate his massive size.

$a[&#39;Aaah~&#39;]

The vampire&#39;s hands move from your hips to your breasts, teasing them lightly before giving a firm squeeze. (if: $piercing is &quot;spider&quot;)[$R[&#39;I see you&#39;ve gotten yourself some accessoriesss,&#39;] he wheezes, fingers pulling on your spider rings.]

He pulls out, only to thrust in again, picking up the pace and sending your entire body shaking with each push. 

$a[&#39;Aaah, yes~&#39;]

You shamelessly spread your legs even further apart, giving him the best angle to take advantage of your  exquisite body. Skulls and bones are hitting your ankles, but you don&#39;t care. No one has ever taken you like this before.

His pace accelerates yet again and you realize that he&#39;s preparing for the finish. Your body tenses in anticipation and you can swear that you feel your cervix opening and inviting him deeper.

Warm and abundant, the Elder&#39;s seed begins unrelentlessly pouring into you. It feels almost as your pussy is drinking it, absorbing everything like the sweetest ambrosia. It tightens and clenches around him, savoring every drop and pulling everything deeper and deeper inside of you. 

$a[&#39;Oh my god yes, yeees~&#39;]

Coming by surprise, your body is shaken in an orgasm and you let yourself fall in his hands, hanging like a little ragdoll in the giant creature&#39;s embrace.

The bracelet glows hot on your wrist and you can see not one but $cri[**two** crimson beads] blossom on your bracelet.

Eventually, the feeling subsides and you fall down to the floor, skin glistening with sweat and pussy dripping with juices. Your eyes meet the empty sockets of a skull right in front of you, but you can&#39;t help but chuckle to yourself.

$A[What a man...]

The Elder doesn&#39;t say anything, giving you a moment to get dressed and back on your feet in your own time.

$Y[&#39;That I did. And I can. But nothing comes for free, young girl.&#39;] 

There&#39;s an odd glint in her eye and you remind yourself to keep your wits about you. $a[&#39;Let&#39;s not play games this time. What do you want?&#39;]

$Y[&#39;But life **is** a game, the greatest game of all,&#39;] grins the old hag, showing a row of white teeth. $Y[&#39;Refusing to accept it, does not mean that you&#39;re not playing.&#39;] She winks at you and a wave of goosebumps rises trickles down your spine. $Y[&#39;But worry not, dearie, gran likes you and will extend a fair offer - fairer than most you&#39;ll have, believe you me.&#39;] She cackles ominously and for a moment you feel almost protected in her small little hut, compared to everything that may lay ahead.

$A[Does she see the future? Or is she just messing with me...?]

$Y[&#39;It&#39;s very simple,&#39;] she continues. $Y[&#39;a drop of youth in a bucket, that&#39;s all that ol&#39; gran requires. And after that I will whisper a secret.&#39;]

$a[&#39;You mean that you want to milk me, just like last time?&#39;]

So I&#39;m extending an offer - gain a favor from gran, for an hour of your time. It&#39;s a good deal, girl. The best you&#39;ll get around &#39;ere&#39;]

The old woman&#39;s eyes move to the steaming decoction in front of you, then back to you. Her thin smile looks bemused and you have a hard time deciding if she&#39;s being friendly or mocking you.

$A[I&#39;m not at all convinced I can trust her...]

Still, the offer is tempting. You&#39;ve been through the ordeal once and you know that the process is not permanent. And if you can get some useful information out of her, perhaps it will all be worth it.

The steam blows up around you, creating a pleasant and light-headed sensation. There&#39;s a distant warmth in your body and a tingling anticipation around your breasts. You can almost feel the bony fingers reaching yout to squeeze the milk out of your nipples...

The old woman gives a small sigh. $Y[&#39;I expected you to know this already, girl. But &#39;ery well. You will drink your tea and we will go to the barn where ol&#39; gran will squeeze some delightful youthful juices out of you.

$Y[&#39;Over &#39;here, dearie,&#39;] comes a voice from infront and you strut forward, following the general direction. 

As you continue crawling on all fours, blades of grass rub against your skin, caressing your hanging breasts. There is a strange sense of $a[freedom] and you are tempted to lie down and just enjoy the sun, but something keeps pulling you alone.

$Y[&#39;Come on, come on.&#39;]

You take another few steps and pause. Something itches at the top of your head and you shake it, trying to get rid of the sensation, but it only grows stronger. You can feel strange new forms beginning to form and your hearing begins to sharpen, catching all the sounds of wind and birds around you.

A small tug pulls you in the right direction and you reluctantly obey, taking another few steps in the grass. Parts of your skin are becoming strangely patchy, light and dark alternating. The itch on your head is growing stronger, as two fluffy ears sprout between your dark hair.

$Y[&#39;Don&#39;t be afraid now, come &#39;ere...]

Another pull forward and you stumble over the threshold of a door and look up to the old woman. She is smiling and gesturing to follow her inside.

$A[I wonder if this new anatomy would be better suited towards... certain activities...]

As soon as the thought pops in your mind your asshole responds, twitching eagerly. You have never realized exactly how much you wanted something in there. Something to fill you up and make you feel good.

$A[No, no, now&#39;s not the time for this...]

You have other, important things to do. And yet your ass seems to have a mind of its own, opening lewdly as if to invite anyone who might be looking.

There is a strange relief in the process, a deep-rooted need being fulfilled. It&#39;s natural, irresitable, *inevitable*.

As your breasts swell with milk to the brim, ready to burst, you naturally begin to seek a way to relieve yourself of this growing burden.

You are led over a beam for support and your heavy breasts weigh down, almost pinning you to the ground. As a wrinkled hand grabs one of them and squeezes forward, you can feel an almost ecstatic relief.

$a[&#39;Aaah~&#39;]

This is it. This is what you needed. Every repetition of the motion solidifies your complacency. How could you ever think to run away or protest? You $A[need] this.

You bow your head and stifle your whimpers. Sweet relief washes over your entire body and you tremble softly in satisfaction every time a strem of milk is squeezed out of you. The other cows in the barn lift their heads, giving you a knowing look, then return to slowly chewing their meals.

$Y[&#39;Well done, dearie,&#39;] pats you the old woman. $Y[&#39;that&#39;s all for now. Old gran will wait for you back at the house. Find me in your own time.&#39;]

Clumsily, you begin to undress, but you keep getting tangled in the layers of your $suit. Luckily for you, the old woman gives you a hand, carefully folding your clothes on the chair beside you.

$Y[&#39;Ah, youth! Nothing like it.&#39;] A bony hand wraps around your waist, fingers running up and down your surves. The sensation is strangely calming, and you dare not chase it away. $Y[&#39;Pretty little lamb you are... and you will give gran exactly what she wants.&#39;]

The hand cups around your breats and squeezes them hard. $a[&#39;A-ah~&#39;]

$Y[&#39;I was young and wild too, you know, ah such good times... but let&#39;s not forget the order of things now.&#39;] She lifts the cup to your lips, holding your head as you begin to gulp down the last drops.

$Y[&#39;You&#39;re doing great, dear! There&#39;s only a little bit left... probably best if you drink it ... well done.&#39;]

You body feels hot and funny. The room is spinning now and you&#39;re finding it harder and harder to stay on your feet. In a moment, you collapse on the floor, crawling naked and disoriented.

$A[Don&#39;t panic, don&#39;t panic, this is normal, don&#39;t panic...]

You can feel a tingling sensation as your body begins to change. Your eyes squint at the sunlight streaming in through the window of the hut. You don&#39;t quite realize what&#39;s going on anymore, but you are taken by a deep desire to be outside, with the sun and grass.

You linger at the barn, mind spinning in slow, fuzzy patterns. There is something incredibly peaceful about just being here, being taken care of, being safe.

You flap your tail in contentment.

As time trickles by, the $a[haze] in your mind slowly begins to disperse and you notice the dark patches on your skin beginning to fade. You feel a distant sadness, as if something is being taken away from you.

Your tail is shorter than before, and as you reach around to examine it, you find yourself standing back on your own two feet again.

$A[Is it- is it over....?]

A sense of clarity floods your mind like cold rain after a summer heatwave. Your breathing accelerates and icy chills run down your spine.

$A[No, no, don&#39;t go...]

You grab a beam to steady yourself and your nails dig into the wood while your body trembles and morphs, until finally you are you again. Just Alex. Just a human. A naked girl, standing in the barn. 

One of the cows gives a &#39;moo&#39; in your direction and suddenly a wave of $a[shame] drowns your conscious.

$a[&#39;Dammit!! I was almost ready to stay here forever... and this time the old wench wasn&#39;t even trying to trick me...&#39;]

You step outside the pen and shake your head and arms, regaining the last of your senses. The cow moos again, this time more insistently. It seems like it&#39;s trying to draw your attention.

You lean on the well to steady yourself and your nails dig into the stones while your body trembles and morphs, until finally you are you again.

Just Alex. Just a human. A naked girl, peering down a hole. Deep in the darkness, something shiny glistens, but you can&#39;t quite tell what it is. 

As you look back up, the sun is still in almost the same position as when you first arrived.

$A[It&#39;s almost as if no time has passed at all...]

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/yaga.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;You enter the hut without knocking, finding the old woman sitting at the table, waiting for you. She is drinking a glass of milk, the skin on her face looking somehow smoother than before.

$Y[&#39;Have a seat, dearie. You must be tired.&#39;]

You pull a chair and sit. The wooden surface feels rough on your naked ass, though the sensation is not entirely unpleasant. Your companion doesn&#39;t seem the least bit bothered by your nudity and is even allowing herself a glint of unabashed enjoyment out of the situation.

$a[&#39;Who are you, really?&#39;] you blurt out, staring her dead in the eyes.

The old woman erupts in laughter, light and whimsical, forcing her to put down her glass of milk for a moment. $Y[&#39;The young calf is asking for her gran?&#39;] You blush at the remark, but force yourself yo hold her gaze. $Y[&#39;Ery well, dearie. Time&#39;s as good as any for introductions. They call me Yaga.&#39;] She leans back and takes another sip from your milk. 

$a[&#39;**They** call you? Or is that your name?&#39;]

$Y[&#39;It is a name, and it is mine,&#39;] she chuckles. $Y[&#39;Ol&#39; gran &#39;as &#39;ad many names. But you can call me Baba, as I will take good care of ya, while you&#39;re &#39;ere...&#39;]

You notice something strange about her speech - it is sometimes clear and eloquent, and sometimes slurred and almost senile, as if the old woman can&#39;t quite make up her mind. The changes seem a little unnerving, but you push the thought aside for later.

$a[&#39;You promised to tell me a secret.&#39;]

$Y[&#39;I did, didn&#39;t I? And I will. Ol&#39; Baba always keeps &#39;er word. But I&#39;ll de ya one better, dearie - clean my kitchen, and I&#39;ll tell ye **three** secrets instead.&#39;]

You take a moment to consider her proposal. It seems almost too generous to be true, but after all you&#39;ve been through just for one secret, doing a little extra to tripple it sounds very appealing...

Rizing from your chair, you throw a quick glance around for your clothes, but can&#39;t quite spot them anywhere. The old witch ignores your quizical look and continues sipping your milk with a slight smirk on her face.

$A[So that&#39;s how it is...] You sigh and get to work.

The kitchen is small, but you find a surprising amount of things to do. Clean the cups, scrub the pans, tidy the spices on the shelves. As you work naked, you&#39;re almost expecting a shrivelled hand to grab your ass or to caress your back, but nothing of the sort happens. In fact, Yaga seems to ignore you almost completely, leaving you slightly confused about the whole situation.

While your hands keep rubbing, scrubbing and brushing, you find your mind slipping in a calm, almost meditative state. After the whole ordeala t the barn, it&#39;s nice to do something simple, something that does not require you to think or to make decisions.

You can&#39;t quite tell how long you&#39;ve been at it, but the kitchen is finally done. It feels like at least an hour, but the light from the window hasn&#39;t changed one bit. You sit back at the table, lifting your eyes at the old woman.

The pregnant one doesn&#39;t pay much attention to you, panting heavily in her pen. $A[She must be Ana...] You can tell that the poor creature is struggling, though you can&#39;t quite read her expression.

The second one, Talyssa, returns your look, just like before. You give her a gentle pat on the head and she moos back.

As you continue your descent, the feeling of vulnerability continues to increase, though you try your best to suppress it, reminding yourself that you&#39;ve survived worse situations. 

Eventually, your feet feel the slimy embrace of muddy soil benath. You&#39;ve made it to the bottom of the well. You let go of the rope and look around. There&#39;s a thin trickle of light coming from above, just enough to shine on the $in[small, glistening object] half-buried in the ground.

Despite the unusual start of your companionship with Yaga, you gave grown strangely attached to her. Her competence and skills are beyond question, and she seems to have accumulated a fair share of wisdom through her years. Surely she wouldn&#39;t let anything truly awful befall her protegé.

$Y[&#39;Very well, dear. In that case, I will show you the secret behind young Ana&#39;s condition. It&#39;s about time her sister followed as well.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Her condition? You mean being pregnant?&#39;]

$Y[&#39;Not just pregnant, dearie. She&#39;s pregnant from Jupiter.&#39;]

$a[&#39;What? You mean like... the planet?&#39;]

$Y[&#39;The Moon&#39;s husband,&#39;] she corrects you with a smile. $Y[&#39;Jupiter roams the lands, searching for his betrothed. While she sings in the sky, occasionally shining her light on special women, tricking Jupiter to think that they&#39;re her, and impregnating them.&#39;]

$a[&#39;That&#39;s- uhm-&#39;] You scratch your head. $a[&#39;Far from me to kink shame the Moon, but all those kids...&#39;]

$Y[&#39; Jupiter&#39;s children cannot be born of mortal women. They only swell their bellies and breasts, so that the Moon can drink their milk every month.&#39;]

$a[&#39;So.... they just stay pregnant... forever?&#39;]

$Y[&#39;Most go mad after a while. Luckily for the two sisters, simple cow minds donnot suffer from such afflications. I told you that it is a kindness, dear girl. Shall we go now?&#39;]

Yaga leads you outside, halting in the middle of the yard. The sunny calmness of the mountain clearing makes her previous talk of the Moon and Jupiter sound like a distant fable, a child&#39;s tale. Looking at the green grass and clucking chickens feels so earthly, so normal. And yet you&#39;ve seen cows at the barn and you must remind yourself of the reality of things.

$a[&#39;So now what?&#39;]

You hesitate, but something in Talyssa&#39;s voice finally compells you. You can&#39;t do this to her. You open the sister&#39;s pens and then head down to the end of the barn, opening a small back door.

Ana seems confused by the whole situation, but Talyssa moves forward, leading her sister outside. She turns her head to look at you, meeting your eyes for the last time.

$Tal[&#39;Thank you for your kindness. I won&#39;t forget it.&#39;]

The two sisters head into the forest, Talyssa pushing Ana along, disappearing among the trees. You sigh and prepare to meet the old witch&#39;s displeasure. It&#39;s a choice you&#39;ll have to live with.

You move Talyssa forward, handing the leash to the witch.

Suddenly, you hear a distant sound in the forest, like galloping hooves, headed towards your direction. Yaga begins to chant and the moon glows brighter, a ray of shining light descending down to the center of the yard.

You hold your breath, excited and slightly terrified.

The sound of hooves is growing louder and louder. You can feel your heart pounding in your chest. The ground trembles. The Moon seems to be growing somehow larger.

Suddenly a giant, white bull bursts through the trees, leaping towards the hut, only to pause at the last moment in front of Yaga. A puff of white dust blows through his nose as the bull looks around. The witch turns towards you. $Y[&#39;You can do the honors, girl. Bring the sister into the moonlight!&#39;]

$A[Here goes nothing....]

Unsure what to do, you just approach the cow and extend the coin towards her. You feel a soft pull and your hand is guided towards Talyssa&#39;s forehead, where the coin begins to glow brighter and brighter the closer it gets. 

Talyssa&#39;s eyes are fixated on it, yearning for the coin. You feel a strange power flowing through you and suddenly visions flash before your eyes: a young maiden walking through the forest, then two sisters talking, a boy, by an old stone well.

$A[Are these... Talyssa&#39;s memories....?]

You pause your hand, just an inch away from Talyssa. She seems to want them back, but you begin to question if this really is wise. The old with took them away from her for a reason. She would probably not be happy if you have them back and besides - Talyssa might not be happy to be fully aware of her current predicament.

She raises an eyebrow, eyes piercing through you. $Y[&#39;I see. That is greatly unfortunate, girl. But we&#39;ll have to make do.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Make do?&#39;]

Suddenly, you hear a distant sound in the forest, like galloping hooves, headed towards your direction. Yaga begins to chant and the moon glows brighter, a ray of shining light descending down to the center of the yard.

$a[&#39;W-what&#39;s going on?&#39;]

The sound of hooves is growing louder and louder. You can feel your heart pounding in your chest. The ground trembles. The Moon seems to be growing somehow larger.

Suddenly a giant, white bull bursts through the trees, leaping towards the hut, only to pause at the last moment in front of Yaga.

You roll on the ground, dazed by the unexpected force and impact of the slap. Your ears are ringing and the world is spinning in a blur around you. As you lift your eyes up you see the full Moon, shining bright, it&#39;s beam streaming down right on top of you.

$a[&#39;No, I&#39;m not you! Let me go!&#39;] You try to get up, but a shrivelled hand grabs you by the hair and holds you down to the ground, right in the center of the moon beam.

$Y2[&#39;Where do you think you&#39;re going, girl? Jupiter needs his bride, or he will be furious.&#39;]

You begin to struggle, but the grip is just too strong. Your vision is still swaying mildly, but you manage to steal a glimpse up. Through the white moon ray descending upon you you can see Yaga, old and powerful, her wrinkled face stern like a monolith chiseled from the rains and winds of a thousand years.

Your skin is now like ivory, pale and smooth. The witch grabs your clothes and tears the away, letting the moon beam shine on every inch of your body. You are dazed in the moonlight, unable to speak or think, your naked flesh glistening and calling to be taken.

The sound of hooves circles around you and then a the giant bull leaps on top of you, pinning you to the ground. Your ass rises in the air, meeting its giant erect member and in an instant he&#39;s riding you. 

$A[No, no, no no no...]

His giant member slides all the way in, stretching you along the way, sliding deeper than you ever thought possible. You are overwhelmed by pleasure and lust, as well as an intense sense of impending doom.

The bull keeps thrusting and suddenly you realize that the witch is no longer holding you down. You are on all fours, head to the ground and legs spread apart, though you don&#39;t have the willpower or capacity to move from your position.

As her hands squeeze down your breasts you can feel the pleasure building up and releasing, followed by a an almost orgasmic feeling when the stream of milk is released.

Suddenly, you hear a distant sound in the forest, like galloping hooves, headed towards your direction. Yaga begins to chant and the moon glows brighter, a ray of shining light descending down to the center of the yard.

You hold your breath, excited and slightly terrified.

The sound of hooves is growing louder and louder. You can feel your heart pounding in your chest. The ground trembles. The Moon seems to be growing somehow larger.

Suddenly a giant, white bull bursts through the trees, leaping towards the hut, only to pause at the last moment in front of Yaga. A puff of white dust blows through his nose as the bull looks around. The witch turns towards you. $Y[&#39;You can do the honors, girl. Bring the sister into the moonlight!&#39;]

Walking barefoot in the hay, you approach the cow. It&#39;s the same one that was giving you the strange looks earlier. It shakes your head and moos again, as if it&#39;s trying to tell you something.

$a[&#39;What is it?&#39;]

You&#39;re not quite sure if you&#39;re expecting a response, but at this stage nothing would quite surprise you. The cow shakes its head and then leans it to one side. It feels like it&#39;s pointing to something at the other end of the barn.

You head further down, checking out an empty pen at the far end. There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything much here, except for $in[a coil of rope] tossed in the corner.

You approach the well again, trotting naked on the fresh grass. There is no one around.

As you lean to peer into it, the glitter at the bottom seems somehow even shinier than before, as if it&#39;s calling to you.

$A[I guess I could try climbing down...]

You look around again. The old woman is nowwhere to be seen.

You tie the rope to the top of the well and give it a tug. The old wooden beam cracks ominously, but seems solid enough.

$A[Hopefully it will hold...]

You grab the rope tightly with both hands and carefully lower yourself into the well. The stones feel cold and coarse under your bare feet. Your heart is pounding. You make a few steps down and the edge disappears over your head, the darkness thickening with every inch you gain.

$A[What am I getting myself into...]

As you continue your descent, the feeling of vulnerability continues to increase, though you try your best to suppress it, reminding yourself that you&#39;ve survived worse situations. 

Eventually, your feet feel the slimy embrace of muddy soil benath. You&#39;ve made it to the bottom of the well. You let go of the rope and look around. There&#39;s a thin trickle of light coming from above, just enough to shine on the $in[small, glistening object] half-buried in the ground.

(link:&#39;(display:&quot;goto&quot;)Pick up the object&#39;)[You reach in the mud and your fingers wrap around something round and hard. As you lift it closer to examine, you see a metal disc that looks like some sort of coin. It has strange engravings that you can&#39;t recognize.

You climb out of the well, pulling yourself along the rope. After some panting and swearing, you are again on the lawn, feet covered in mud.

$Moon[my Jupiter of rage]

&lt;=
As the moonlight intensifies, you can feel something deep inside of you, A Womanly need, a fate and a seal. You can feel two orbs of fire below your belly, burning, yearning in anticipation. A small fragment of sanity still holding in your mind grasps the implications, but it&#39;s too late to do naything.

$A[No, no, this can&#39;t be happening....]

The bull thrusts in deeper and you can feel your pussy opening, allowing Him to slide all the way in, deeper into your core, deeper into your womb.

His body tenses and for a long moment you know exactly what&#39;s going to happen.

You brace yourself. You bite your lip. Your fingers dig into the dirt. Your mind surrenders and you spread even further apart. Waiting. Anticipating. Allowing him in.

Then Jupiter comes.

The bull begins pouring his seed into you and your whole body begins to shake. You can feel your womb filling, expanding. The two balls of flame explode like shining stars and all of the resistance that you had, will ever have, is disintegrated into nothingness.

$a[&#39;Aaaahhh~&#39;] It&#39;s too late. The deed is done. Your muscles contract and your pussy clenches tightly around the bull&#39;s giant member, shaking into a climax that drinks every last drop of his cursed seed.

Consciousness does not come easily. You drift slowly to awareness, waiting for clarity that never comes. Your whole body is aching, tired, bloated and abused. You can tell that you are in a pen, resting your neck on a beam, your big, heavy belly hanging beneath you.

And there is something else. A feeling in your chest, a deep $a[need] that has to be fulfilled. Your breasts are round and heavy, almost ready to burst. You try to do something about it, but you can barely lift your arms and legs from the ground, and when you finally manage to lift one, your hooves just awkwardly press against the sensitive spot.

$Y[&#39;Just about ready, aren&#39;t you dearie?&#39;]

The voice is somehow familiar, but you can&#39;t recall where from. The only thing that you know is that you are waiting, begging for relief. A bony hand grabs your tit and squeezes a stream out, producing instant but temporary relief.

You can feel it. The precipice is coming closer and closer. Your pussy opens, gaping and needy, though there&#39;s nothing to fill it. You take a step closer to the edge. You&#39;re almost there. Her motions accelerate, then she pauses for a second.

$Y[&#39;You&#39;re such a good little sow, do you know that, girl?&#39;] Then the old woman squeezes harder, sending a large stream of milk gushing out of your inflated breasts. 

$a[&#39;AAAAHHHH~~~&#39;]

The climax washes over you like a tidal wave, unbridled by any shame or pretense of modesty. A wet stream of juices shoots out of your pussy, splashing in the hay behind you.

After she&#39;s done talking she reaches back and hands you a heap of clothes. $Y[&#39;Our arrangement has been honored. You are free to go.&#39;]

$a[&#39;It has indeed,&#39;] you nod slowly. $a[&#39;Though I can&#39;t say that it was quite what I expected.&#39;]

$Y[&#39;You should toss away your expectations, girl. The world is so much more than you imagine.&#39;]

You sigh. You have indeed learned many things from the witch. Though the ending does not bring you joy.

$a[&#39;I have to go now.&#39;]

$Y[&#39;As you wish.&#39;]

You slowly walk away from the yard, disappearing into the forest.

Instinctively, you repeat the words after her. The world shifts again and in the blink of an eye it&#39;s day again. Dazed, Talyssa slowly returns her gaze to you.

$Tal[&#39;What have you done to me?&#39;]

$Y[&#39;Hush now, cow! Back to the barn, or I&#39;ll have you for dinner!&#39;]

Talyssa bows her head and begins walking back to the barn. You can see her belly already starting to swell and her stride slowing down. 
 
$Y[&#39;You&#39;ve done well, dearie. Don&#39;t dwell on her - her fate was sealed long ago. You have managed to put yourself ahead in the game, this is what should matter to you now.&#39;]

You take the leash again and pull, but Talyssa begins to resist, visibly distraught. After some pulling and tugging, you finally manage to drag her to the center of the light pouring down.

$Moon[for Jupiter the brave]

&lt;=
The light intensifies and Talyssa&#39;s becomes like ivory, pale and smooth. With a puff of air, the giant bull leaps on top of her, pinning the poor creature to the ground. He is almost twice her size and she has no way to resist him. 

You watch, mezmerized nad horrified, as he begins to ride her wildly, more rage than passion, eyes flaming and tongue drooling. Talyssa&#39;s eyes grow wide and she looks at you with a last plea.

$Tal[&#39;Please, stop this! I don&#39;t want to end up like Ana!&#39;]

$Y[&#39;I see that you&#39;ve found her memories. Well done, girl&#39;]

$a[&#39;You aren&#39;t mad?&#39;] You raise an eyebrow at the witch.

$Y[&#39;You brought her here, that&#39;s what matters. You could use this opportunity. In a moment like this there will be a strong imprint, something that might serve you well for your future.&#39;]

$a[&#39;And what of her?&#39;] 

$Y[&#39;Her fate is already sealed. Is it not wise to make the most of it?&#39;]

You look at Talyssa, who is already panting heavily under Jupiter. You have to admit that the witch has a point.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Use the coin on Talyssa]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1995" name="Use the coin on Talyssa" tags="hutn" position="6481,9197" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-HUT-]&lt;/div&gt;

You let the coin pull you closer and closer to Talyssa. Being pinned under the white bull, getting to her is not easy, but you finally manage to do it and the metal coin sticks to her forehead, beginning to glow softly.

You can see the betrayal in her eyes, but try to ignore it. Her hips are already swinging in unison with Jupiter&#39;s desires. The coin begins to glow and you feel the energy being poured into it.

$Tal[&#39;Why? Why did you do this?&#39;] 

You ignore her and continue the process until you feel it&#39;s complete. The coin is bright now, brighter than before. It is done.

Jupiter huffs at you and begins unleashing his lust and wrath and ravaging Talyssa. You take a step back, putting the coin back in your pocket. The moonlight shines upon them, twinkling happily at the sight.

$Moon[my Jupiter of rage]

&lt;=
At last, the ordeal is complete. Jupiter gives a mighty roar and leasp away, disappearing into the forest. The moon beam begins to dissipate. As Yaga lifts her arms to the sky once more, her chanting echoes through the forest:

You take a deep breath and extend the coin a little further, letting it touch Talyssa&#39;s forehead. The glow intensifies and the visions explode - you see her growing up and becomming a woman, you see her sister, her parents, her young lover. Then the glow suddenly fades, the golden color draining from the metal until only a dark, empty shell remains.

It&#39;s done. Talyssa lifts her eyes to you.

$Tal[&#39;Thank you stranger.&#39;]

You give her a timid smile. Then you suddenly remember why you&#39;re here. 

$a[&#39;I have to take you with me...&#39;]

Fear creeps in immediately. $Tal[&#39;You don&#39;t have to do this. Whatever it is the old witch is up to, it doesn&#39;t look good. Let us go, we&#39;ll run from the back.&#39;]

You hesitate at her plea. The witch would not be happy if you freed the sisters, you&#39;re sure of that. But now that Talyssa has gained her awareness back, subjugating her to this fate feels unthinkable...

Suddenly, you can feel the door of the barn creaking. You turn around - there isn&#39;t anyone there.

You can feel the siren&#39;s sway washing over you like waves, each one pulling you deeper and deeper into her blue eyes. She is dancing, swirling, trying to seduce you. It is her nature, her instinct. Without knowing anything about you, she already wants to pull you into the depths with her.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/join_me2.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

She continues swirling, smiling and extending a hand towards you. An ethereal melody fills the air and even though you recognize the trap for what it is, you can&#39;t help but feel a growing warmth in your belly and a deep-rooted desire to plunge into her embrace.

You carefully consider how to approach the conversation.

$a[&#39;You may not know a lot about me. But I know everything about **you**,&#39;] you say confidently, smirking down at Narcissa.

$a[&#39;We are not so different, you and I,&#39;] you smile back, tracing a finger along the water&#39;s surface. $a[&#39;We both feed of lust and passion, grab souls and hearts.&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/join_me2.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
The siren seems puzzled by your words and swims a little closer to the surface. This time you can see her tentacles splashing and squirming underneath, though her eyes keep drawing your gaze like endless saphire wells.

$N[&#39;Who are you, girl? How do you know me?&#39;]

$a[&#39;Lavius told me tales of you,&#39;] you giggle and wink at her, leaving an intentional implication hang in the air. $N[&#39;You must be **so** important to him...&#39;]

Something flashes in her eyes and her tentacles twitch, before resuming their underwater dance.

$N[&#39;So my love has found a new toy it seems...&#39;] Her smile blossoms again and she beckons you with a finger. You see her radiant and beautiful, her song filling the chamber, her face smooth and angelic as a goddess. $N[&#39;Come, girl, tell me all about it...&#39;]

The heat in your belly flares up and you find yourself leaning over the surface of the water. You have to act quickly.

She stirs herself towards the surface and suddenly you find yourself face to face with those beautiful eyes. You remember her salty embrace, and the forbidden pleasures that it brings.

Narcissa smiles and every so slightly drifts deeper. You find your body following suit and inching downwards to chase her. She drifts again, her eyes pulling you down, down into the song, into her lips, into the depths...

$A[No, no, no....]

By the time you realize what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s too late. You lose your balance and fall farward head first. Her extended hand catches yours and yanks you down, and you find yourself [[underwater]].

$a[&#39;Why don&#39;t **you** come here instead? I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get along wonderfully...&#39;]

She stirs herself towards the surface and suddenly you find yourself face to face with those beautiful eyes. You remember her salty embrace, and the forbidden pleasures that it brings.

Narcissa smiles and you smile back. You push your top aside and shamelessly let your $breasts hang out, just above the surface of the water. You can feel a deep-rooted power in you. Your belly burns hot, but this time it&#39;s not the heat controlling you, but you channeling the heat.

Ever so slowly, Narcissa comes closer and closer, until finally the top of her head reaches the surface and she breaks above water.

$a[&#39;Hello, gorgeous,&#39;] you smile devilishly, licking your lips. Not giving her a moment to think, you wrap your arm around her waist and pull her up towards you, giving her a passionate kiss. Your naked breasts are rubbing against each other while salt water drips down her skin.

After the longest moment, you finally pull away from her mouth, allowing her to take a much needed breath. The poor siren looks at you with the deepest confusion you have ever seen.

$N[&#39;That was--- I-&#39;]

$a[&#39;I told you we should get to know each other,&#39;] you wink at her.

Narcissa looks at you, then her cheecks blush a deep red and she dives back into the depths, leaving nothing but bubbles behind her.

You bend over some more. The siren&#39;s song is mezmerizing, but you still have enough control of your senses. You look into her eyes and pretend to be under her spell, swaying gently with her melody.

$a[&#39;You are so beautiful...&#39;]

She smiles and waves a finger for you to join her, but you pretend not to see it, giggling and drooling with a dumb grin on your face. After a few moments, she stirs herself closer towards the surface, trying to beckon you again:$N[&#39;Come, girl, join me....&#39;]

$a[&#39;Your hair is all floaty....&#39;] you blabber, still smiling stupidly.

Frustrated, Narcissa floats closer still, her tentacles reaching up to grab you. At the last moment, you swing and she grasps empty air, her tentacles falling over the edge of the box.

Not skipping a beat, you slam the lid down, pinching her tentacles in place. $a[&#39;Ha! Thought you had me, didn&#39;t you?&#39;]

Narcissa howls with pain and fury, wriggling angrily to free herself.

$N[&#39;What do you want, vile demon? To humiliate me?!&#39;]

$a[&#39;I only wanted to talk, you&#39;re the one who tried to drown me!&#39;] you spit right back at her.

Narcissa looks at you, furious. She is suddenly ugly, long teeth sticking out of her gaping maw.

$N[&#39;I&#39;ll have you, just you wait!&#39;]

With a final effort, she manages to squeeze out of the pinch and dives back into the depths, leaving nothing but bubbles behind her.

Your focus shifts and you find yourself enthralled in her angelic aura once again. Narcissa floats closer still, her tentacles slowly drifting around her, elegant and serene. How can you not look at them?

$A[So pretty....]

By the time you realize what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s too late. A tentacle has wrapped around your wrist and pulls you in. You tip over and fall farward head first. Her extended hand catches yours and yanks you down, and you find yourself [[underwater]].

You feel completely helpless as your legs are being spread apart. The siren&#39;s tentacles are much stronger than you, leaving you no room for resistance. With great effort you manage to twist your head back, staring wide-eyes into the hideous maw of an angler fish, positioning ominously towards your opening.

$N[&#39;So even demons can be broken,&#39;] she giggles. $N[&#39;Very well, girl.&#39;] The teasing tendrils gently spread your pussy apart and the second tentacle plunges in, giving you exactly what you are craving.

$N[&#39;I will give you pleasure you&#39;ve never even dreamt of...&#39;]

As the pace accelerates, you give in completely. There&#39;s no point fighting it now. Narcissa holds you firmly in place as the two tentacles ravage your holes, combining and alternating, teasing and stretching.

The water around you seems to darken as the oxygen in your lungs runs out, but even so the intense sensations cause your eyes to roll over.

You are clinging for life, hopelessly, and yet you find yourself battling the seconds not to live, but to reach something while you&#39;re still here, a forbidden pleasure that you so desperately need.

$N[&#39;Are you ready, my little whore? It&#39;s now or never.&#39;]

She finally wraps a tentacle around your throat, squeezing hard. Your body tenses and the tentacles speed up, wriggling violently inside you. In your last moments a powerful orgasm washes over you, shattering your mind and body.

$N[&#39;As you wish,&#39;] she hisses. The tentacle plunges deeper into your bowels, causing you to shake and squirm. The tendrils that are caressing your folds continue to tease you mercilessly with no intention to give you the pleasure that you crave.

You try to focus on the moments when **you** took control of the situation. Your $in[golden eyes] begin to shine brighter and for a moment the song seems to fade and you feel some small semblance of control returning.

Annoyed, Narcissa doubles her efforts. A moist tentacle caresses your cheek.  You whip your $in[tail], pushing it away. Eyes locked into each other, the battle for control intensifies.

$a[&#39;You are not the only enchantress here, Narcissa...!&#39;]

Another tentacle slides between your legs, trying to rub you. The wave of pleasure begins to creep upwards to your belly.

You grab Narcissa by the throat, stifling her melody. Her tentacles wriggle violently and she chokes and spits at you, but the spell is broken. You can move freely again, and so can everyone else.

Focusing your sudden strength, you dash towards the box and throw her into the depths. Water splashes all around the dungeon floor and you quickly close the lid, sealing her away.

$R[&#39;It&#39;s overh, boy,&#39;] comes a low, hissing voice. As you turn around, you see the Elder gripping Lavius again, but this time the flamboyant vampire seems resigned to his fate. He barely lifts an arm up to protect himself as the creature pounds him into the wall. As the dust settles Lavius falls to the floor, caughing up blood.

$R[&#39;Take themh all to the dhungeon... to await trialh...&#39;]

Mihai picks up Lavius and begins to drag him away. A quick and fiery look from the Elder prods the wolf to stand down and follow suit willingly, head bowing down. Finally, the Elder turns to you.

Still a little shellshocked by the events, you leave the basement and head back to your room in the attic. You barely notice the exact moment when your wings fade out into ethereal darkness and the surge of demonic power quiets down, returning to a soft warmth somewhere below your belly.

$A[I guess I really am a demon now...]

The thought comes to you naturally and you quietly acknowledge the reality of your situation. You have changed so much that you begin to question if returning back would even feel right at this point.

There is a solemn air in the dining room. A table is set for two in the center, Mihai already waiting on one side of it. He gestures to the other, giving you a thin smile.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$Mi[&#39;I suppose I should begin by expressing my gratitude. You have proven yourself to be both brave and cunning, and it is thanks to your actions that we are sitting here today and having this conversation. Thank you, Miss Alexandara.&#39;]

You blush and akwawkarly look away, not sure how to properly respond to Mihai&#39;s formal address. $a[&#39;I-it&#39;s nothing, I was just doing what any girl... in my position...&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;Still,&#39;] Mihai continues in a deep voice, $Mi[&#39;you should have come to **me** first with the news. Choosing to involve my father has changed the situation entirely and will have far-reaching consequences. Consequences which you cannot fully grasp. Such disobedience would not have come cheaply under other circumstances... but you did save my life.&#39;] Mihai sighs and his tone softens. $Mi[&#39;Tell me, why did you do it?&#39;]

Ionut arrives and offers you a cup of tea, which you gratefully accept. A few sips give you the time to find the right words to respond.

$a[&#39;The plan didn&#39;t work,&#39;] you say gloomily, looking at the floor. A part of you knows that it was your fault for not being strong enough to stand up to Narcissa.

$R[&#39;What happendh...?&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/elder.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot; &gt;
$a[&#39;We barged into the room below. You had dealt with Lavius&#39; men easily, just as expected. But then...&#39;]

$R[&#39;Then?&#39;]

$a[&#39;It&#39;s that damned siren. She came out of her box and started signing, and everyone froze. I tried to fight her, to seduce her back. For a moment I thought I had even succeeded.... but in the end she was stronger than me.&#39;]

The Elder frowns and tilts his head to the side, thinking. $R[&#39;I understandh... a siren is a serious trump cardh... Lavius has come preparedh. However....&#39;]

$a[&#39;However?&#39;]

The vampire grins. $R[&#39;A succubus is more powerful than sirenh...&#39;]

You take a moment to consider this. $a[&#39;Are you saying that I can win? It felt so close... but then why did I lose? Unless...&#39;] You pause and look at him. He waits, looking strangely amused by the whole situation. $a[&#39;Oh. It&#39;s because I&#39;m not a **real** succubus, isn&#39;t it?&#39;]

$R[&#39;Indeed. Wouldh you like to be?&#39;]

The words hang ominously in the air. You meet the Elder&#39;s flaming eyes and a chill runs down your spine.

$a[&#39;I suppose I have little choice at this point... We need to find a way to beat Lavius and stop this whole conspiracy...&#39;] You look up to the Elder with nervous anticipation. It&#39;s difficult to guess what would happen now, but it seems like you&#39;ve come too far to back down now.

$R[&#39;Goodh answer... you are provingh to be a useful servant, yet aghain... When all this is overh, you will have a place... by my sidhe...&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/elder.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot; &gt;
The Elder rises from his throne and spreads his wings, stretching. His presence fills the room, a mixture of terror, primal power, as well as something else, a sort of godly, or rather un-godly essence. $A[No wonder they worship him....]

$R[&#39;Come, girl... take my hand...&#39;]

His arm is outsretched, long, muscular and crude. Your small palm is like a child in his, delicate and fragile. He takes it without hesitation and in an instant you are pulled towards the vampire as he presses you against his chest. Then he leaps into the air, slowly flapping his wings. Both of you are suspended in the darkness of the tower, the bones and skulls merging into a grim tapestry below.

You cling against his torso, instinctively digging your nails in to make sure that you don&#39;t fall. But then you realize that you couldn&#39;t even if you wanted to, as he can effortlessly keep you even with one arm. You feel a strange mixture of being safe and owned, two sides of a single coin, the token of your servitude to the strange entity.

As soon as the initial fear and shock of your flight wears off, you feel something poking between your legs. You can&#39;t look down, but you know what it is - and it feels so big. After a moment of hesitation, you know what you must do.

$a[&#39;I- uhm... I was actually trying to revert all these changes, not go further...&#39;]

The Elder frowns and rises from his chair, menacing. $R[&#39;Stupidh whore! Do you not realize you are alerady dhere? Except that you are weakh...&#39;]

There is a determination in his eyes that scares you, but you are too transfixed to look away. His hand extends, a massive palm fastening around your throat. He doesn&#39;t grip you, not yet, instead just resting his fingers, coarse and strong, his claws caressing your jugular.

$R[&#39;Do not whorry, my servanth... I will makhe you strongh...&#39;]

Like a leaf in the wind, the Elder flips you around and pushes you down. You fall, finding yourself pinned to the floor with nowhere to go, his massive weight on top of you. $R[&#39;Now you will understandh...&#39;]

You feel something poking between your legs. You can&#39;t look down, but you know what it is - and it feels so big. Fighting him feels futile. You whimper.

The temptation is great, but in your last moments, you manage to resist it. You cling tightly to the bracelet as a silent scream escapes your lips and lungs begin to fill with water.

$A[I&#39;m not done yet... I&#39;m not done yet...!!]

The singing is washing over you like an ethereal blanket, soothing and compelling you to give up, but the core of your will remains unbroken. You may have lost the battle, but you are determined to come back and win the war.

$a[&#39;I want to know why,&#39;] you say quietly, peering straight into his eyes. $a[&#39;Why turn against the Petrescu family? You seemed to have everything here...&#39;]

$L[&#39;Everything? You must jest.&#39;] he laughs a bitter laugh. $L[&#39;I had luxury, comfort, entertainment, yes. But not freedom. Not progress. Not **love**.&#39;] The last word hangs in the air for a long moment before he eventually continues. $L[&#39;The Petrescus have ruled this domain for centuries. Vasil is is set in his ways - we stay here, we hide, we lurk, we sleep. We do the rituals and we follow the will of the ancients. But now - now things could be different.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Different? Different how?&#39;]

He beckons you closer and you step to the bars of the cell, now face to face with him.

$L[&#39;Imagine a different world, dear. A world of where we live freely instead of hiding away. A world of progress. A world of infinite possibilities. Are you sure you want to rot away with the Petrescus here?&#39;]

As you consider his words, he reaches through the bars, grabbing your waist and pulling you closer. $L[&#39;I know that you are a different kind of person. I can see it in your eyes. And I understand why you did what you did. I have a proposition for you.&#39;]

You can feel your heart pounding in your chest as the vampire peers in your eyes.

You push one of the balls on the pool table, rolling it to a corner. $A[And to think that those two are now locked in the dungeon...]

You walk past the gaming room and enter the library. As usual, the place is eerily quiet, with endless rows of shelves basking in dirty rays of sunshine that stream from the tainted windows. You can see specs of dust hanging in the air, as if frozen in time.

For a moment, you begin to wonder if Felicia&#39;s home has moved again. The library seems back to normal, as much as normal applies to it. But then you take a stroll and begin to feel an all too familiar sensation of distortion. The right turns aren&#39;t entirely right and the straight paths warp and wobble as you try to trace them.

Eventually you arrive at a wooden desk and a smiling cat, who wags her shadow tail gracefully to greet you.

$M[&#39;Well well, if it isn&#39;t my favorite person. I would say my favorite **human**, but judging by your looks, you may have transcended this stage already.&#39;]

$M[&#39;What happend this time, my little human?&#39;]

You look up at Felicia, catching the cat&#39;s mischevious smile. With your horns growing and your new eyes and tail, you barely feel like a human anymore. But then again, you aren&#39;t yet a real succubus either it would seem.

You can&#39;t take this anymore. You want more. You *need* more. You begin frantically undressing, all the while kissing Felicia and rolling in her bed. Finally, you are naked, pressed tightly against Felicia. You kiss her, her curls tingling your chest.

$M[&#39;So what now, my little human? What is it that you truly **want**? Be honest with yourself... and take it&#39;]

Thoughts are swarming your head like angry crows. You have gotten so used to things happening **to** you that the sense of control and choice is almost overwhelming. Yet it&#39;s also deeply liberating. Your $in[tail] waves happily.

There are many things you can do now. Felicia is right next to you, patiently waiting. But you are also starting to understand the lesson that she&#39;s trying to teach you. It&#39;s okay to give and it&#39;s okay to receive. Even if you want to submit to her, that&#39;s still something that you can **take**, that can still be done from a position of control... in a way.

It&#39;s a weird concept, but you&#39;re trying to wrap your mind around it. Being blindflolded in the darkness is odly useful to shed the layers of shame.

You hesitate.

You push Felicia over, climbing on top of the cat as best you can despite your lack of vision. You are following your natural desires like a glowing thread, a direction that is not becoming clearer. You move up until your legs are on both sides of her head. What you are about to do would have been unthinkable, up until now. Now you are about to do it.

A shiver runs down your spine as you stop in a moment of anticipation.

$M[&#39;It&#39;s okay. Come as you are,&#39;] her voice reassures you once again.

You begin lowering your hips, your pussy wet, dripping and ready. Suddenly you feel her mouth touch your folds. It&#39;s just like you imagined it, but better. Her tongue, wet and coarse, begins licking you, each time gently pulling on your sensitive parts, as if tiny hooks are tugging on your flesh.

$a[&#39;Aaaaah!~&#39;] you moan in pleasure, sinking even lower. 

She continues her exploration, lick after lick, until suddenly her tongue pushes inside of you, parting your folds and following the sweetness of your juices. Your head is spinning and your breath starts coming in short. Your fingers dig into her curls. They feel so soft. Soon enough your hips start moving back and forth, synchronizing the pace with her. The $A[heat] is building higher and stronger in your belly. You want more. You **need** to have more.

You give her another, long, passionate kiss and then you slide downards, guiding yourself by touch until you slide between her legs.

Felicia is wearing a skirt, one which you easily manage to lift up. Part of you regrets not being able to take in the sight, but going blind has its own share of excitement. You lean in and taste her. She is everything that you could have imagined, and so much more. 

Part of you wants to dive in and ravage her, but you manage to control yourself. Though &quot;control&quot; isn&#39;t the right word. You try to listen to yourself, to your heart, to your desires, to what&#39;s really deep inside. And right now you want to $A[**submit**].

$M[&#39;It&#39;s okay,&#39;] she whispers again, as if reading your thoughts. $a[&#39;I know. Thank you.&#39;]

You give her a long, slow lick, taking the taste in. Then you angle yourself lower still, chest against the bed, and rise your ass in the air. You can feel the burning in your belly intensify and you spread your legs, as if showing your yearning pussy to an imaginary audience.

Another slow lick fills your mouth with bitter-sweet delight, with a female fragrance and elegance. There is a light fur around her entrance that tickles your lips. You continue your work, cherishing every moment and kindling your own desire higher and higher.

After several minutes, you can tell you are getting close to the edge. The path of your true needs is reaching a conclusion, one only you can truly find.

$M[&#39;Go on. Whatever you need.&#39;]

You whimper and give in to the feeling fully. You are hers. She is yours. Nothing else matters.

$M[&#39;What a brave girl you are. Well done.&#39;]

Her voice is soft and gentle. You resume your work as her hand begins to squeeze, slowly tightening your airways. Your tongue accelerates and your pussy quivers in neediness. But it is a good need. It&#39;s not something lacking, it&#39;s exactly how you want it. How things should be.

Felicia squeezes harder and your head begins to spin. You bury deep in her pussy and surrender to giving her pleasure, to serving her. Your needs are her needs.

Suddenly her back arches in pleasure and a gush of hot juices spurts all over you. Then she squeezes harder, pushing your head in. You drink them greedily, licking every last drop.

You crawl up and kiss her, sinking in her embrace. Saliva, passion and juices mix together in a head-spinning cocktail that you couldn&#39;t believe imaginable. 

$M[&#39;What a brave girl you are....&#39;] she whispers in your ear.

Feeling your pussy burning with need, you press against her, finding her slit, wet and waiting. You begin to rub against her, slowly and forcefully, a deep extasy running though your veins.

$a[&#39;Aaah!~~&#39;]

As your whimpers echo softly, you realize that you&#39;ve never rubbed against a girl before. It feels strange but incredibly fulfilling. You can feel every part of her, and with a few precise motions of your hips, your bud finds hers, rubbing together in a symphony of pleasure.

You roll on the bed next to her, finally taking your blindfold off. She is next to you, smiling widely.

You blush and bury your face in her breasts, covering her with a black wing. What are the implications of this? You don&#39;t know. For now, this moment feels perfect.

You close your eyes again and experience peace.

Time must have passed, for when you open them again, your wings have vanished back, though you can feel them as an ethereal presence, just waiting to sprout out again. Felicia gives you another kiss, then gets up.

$R[&#39;Goodh...&#39;]

You can feel some deep instinct taking over. The $in[terror] that you felt is only adding fuel to the fire and slowly morphing into pure, unbridled $A[lust]. You realize that you don&#39;t care about the consequences. Your rational mind is abandoning calculating chances and danger, risk factors, none of it matters. The important thing is here and now. 

And somewhere, a part of you is even getting $A[excited] by the danger. Wouldn&#39;t that be a fitting end for a succubus? You can barely contain yourself from bouncing like crazy just thinking about it.

As your passionate dance with the Elder reaches a new peak, you suddenly feel him growing still, his hips no longer moving back and forth with yours. Hands wrapped around his neck, you look up, only to face a terrifying grin and two flaming red eyes.

A hand clenches your throat, squeezing tightly. $R[&#39;Dho it... or you are no use to me.&#39;]

Reluctantly, you move your legs apart, feeling his giant member pushing against your entrance. It finds the opening to your entrance, and then he slips inside.

$a[&#39;Aaaahh~&#39;]

He is even bigger than you expected, filling and stretching your tight little pussy to its absolute limit. You are quite certain that your succubus nature is the only reason you are not screaming in pain right now. It actually feels good, so incredibly good.

The Elder makes a slow movement out and in again. You can actually feel your belly shrinking and expanding as he does. A stream of warm juices lubracates his shaft, easing the process and making you shiver with anticipation on how much farther he could go.

$R[&#39;No, my little whore... I will tell you somethingh...&#39;]

$a[&#39;W-what...?&#39;]

A shiver runs down your spine. $A[Why is he telling me this now? Can I really get pregnant? Ah...&#39;]

Your mind is racing to comprehend the situation. Everything is happening so fast. Your dripping pussy is gaping stretched by the largest cock that you&#39;ve ever had.

You can barely control yourself. Your movements become faster and faster as the juices flow and make everything so much easier.

$R[&#39;Goodh...&#39;]

You can feel some deep instinct taking over. The $in[terror] that you felt is only adding fuel to the fire and slowly morphing into pure, unbridled $A[lust]. You realize that you don&#39;t care about the consequences. Your rational mind is abandoning calculating chances and danger, risk factors, none of it matters. The important thing is here and now. 

And somewhere, a part of you is even getting $A[excited] by the danger. Wouldn&#39;t that be a fitting end for a succubus? You can barely contain yourself from bouncing like crazy just thinking about it.

As your passionate dance with the Elder reaches a new peak, you suddenly feel him growing still, his hips no longer moving back and forth with yours. Hands digging into the floor, you look up, only to face a terrifying grin and two flaming red eyes.

You head deeper into the lab, making your way past the machinery and down the stairs where the red carpet leads to the living quarters of the lair&#39;s odd inhabitants.

As usual, you see $in[Lavius&#39; room] on the right, a purple door with a golden handle. Then there is the other door, black with a silver handle - the door to $in[Sabrina&#39;s room].

You give a quick knock on the door and enter the room without waiting. Everything is just as you last left it, with chains and whips hanging from the wall, chalk and candles scattered across the floor. On the bed, you can see Sabrina in full gear, leaning over a tied up female figure...

You pause your step, standing awkwardly for a moment before making a small cough. $a[&#39;I--- I hope I&#39;m not interrupting?&#39;]

Sabrina turns around and her face immediately lights up in a broad grin. $S[&#39;Sis! Those are some wicked horns! Gimme just a moment here...&#39;]

She lifts the girl from the bed and you can see that she&#39;s also blindfolded and gagged, red curls falling down her naked breasts.

$S[&#39;As I said, not like us. She&#39;s a Bruxa, a simple-minded servant. She may look human, but don&#39;t be fooled.

$S[&#39;I&#39;m not sure, sis. I can think of only one way, but it&#39;s dangerous and uncertain. We will be messing with some powerful forces.&#39;]

$a[&#39;I think I&#39;ve had my fair share of danger already. Let&#39;s do this.&#39;]

Sabrina looks at you, then shakes her head. $S[&#39;Not so fast, sis. I&#39;m sorry, but the more I think about this, the more it feels like a bad idea. You didn&#39;t even complete your trainings last time. This will truly be too much for you. And besides - the danger is not just for **you**. While I care and would love to help, I&#39;m not quite ready to put **my** head on the chopping block for you, no offence.&#39;]

$S[&#39;It&#39;s not about that, sis.&#39;] There is a somber note in Sabrina&#39;s voice. $S[&#39;We can use her as a catalyst of sorts.&#39;] 

$a[&#39;A catalyst?&#39;]

$S[&#39;Yes. The temple below is dedicated to an old diety and her powers still run strong in the stone. They have been instrumental to the bruxa project, but that&#39;s another story... If we can channel these energies, we can probably fully awaken your demonic powers. But we will need a sacrifice.&#39;]

$S[&#39;If you ask and get a response you&#39;d certainly be the first. I suppose it doesn&#39;t hurt to try, but it&#39;s not what I&#39;m counting on.&#39;]

$a[&#39;So what then?&#39;]

$S[&#39;Last time we did this, I called the creature here. It may have felt differently to you, but if we have to get technical we were anchoring everyhting in **our** reality. Now we&#39;ll do it the other way around - I&#39;m sending **you** there, to its home, to its realm.&#39;]

A feeling of uneasiness begins to grow in your stomach, but you try to ignore it.

$a[&#39;Why?&#39;] you only manage to mutter.

$S[&#39;The energies will be much stronger there. In an nutshell, what we&#39;re doing is extremely simple - by exposing you to primal energies of Lust, we will supercharge all of the magic you already poses, pushing the processes that have already started in you to their logical conclusion.&#39;]

$a[&#39;That sounds... extreme.&#39;]

$S[&#39;Oh it is,&#39;] she nods cheerfully. $S[&#39;You will experience sensations no mortal mind is meant to touch. But if you don&#39;t go insane everything should be fine. Ready?&#39;]

The room begins to spiral around you and you close your eyes to fight the sudden wave of vertigo. You feel as if you are being sucked out of existence, pulled and stretched through folds into the space itself.

After fragment of eternity, you have the sudden and innate understanding that you are somewhere else. It feels both hot and cold, as if temperature itself has lost all meaning. The space around you is thick and vibrant. You breath in. There is a strange, organic smell.

You can no longer hear Sabrina&#39;s voice, nor see any trace of her room. You are in the space. Alone.

Or not alone.

The $O[Presence] looms over you like a gargantuan nightmare. You know it&#39;s there, you can feel it at the back of your head. Long, skeletal legs gently descend around you as a strange *hum* fills the space, making the thick air vibrate with chitinous promisses.  You are paralized, unable to look up, though a part of you already knows exactly what lies above.

A shiver runs down your spine as the legs keep closing in like prison bars around you and the *hum* keeps growing louder. At last, something hard and pointy clenches around your ribs [[lifting you into the air.-&gt;sab wings3]]

$A[What the hell is this thing?! I remember it being big, but this... this feels ... indescribable...]

The void around you is pulsating and squirming. Space itself is different, thicker, more flexible, less concrete. A growing $a[haze] in your mind makes everything feel like a dream. All you know is that whatever is about to happen, will happen. It&#39;s imminent.

Thick air fills your lung, saturating them with $O[lust and decay]. The *hum* above your head has reached a plateau and you begin to wonder if the chaotic cacaphony does not hold some sort of deeper meaning.

As the thought crosses your mind, more tendrils descend around your head. You can feel them weaving through your hair, wrapping around your neck, and narrowing down on your open orifices. 

Before you have time to scream, (link-reveal:&quot;the tendrils slide in.&quot;)[ 

The struggle is brief, but visceral. They squirm and wiggle their up your nostrils and down your throat. They slide in your ears and your brain and your soul. Your body shivers violentely, though the restraints are holding you firmly in place.

You enter the temple grounds again, naked statues lining your way, frozen in expressions of ecstasy and maddness. Sabrina is walking by your side, her presence a silent catalyst to your resolve.

$A[What must be done must be done....]

As soon as your steps echo in the main hall, Mira emerges from her chamber, strutting along happily. She approaches you eagerly, but you raise a hand.

$a[&#39;Sit,&#39;] you say with a deep, commanding voice. The young Bruxa immediately obeys, kneeling at your feet.

$S[&#39;Good girl. Now put this on.&#39;] Sabrina extends a black cloth towards her and the bruxa eagerly puts the blindfold on. $S[&#39;Good. Now give me your hand.&#39;]

Sabrina takes Mira towards the Altar, where she is placed upright, facing you with legs slightly apart. $S[Spread your arms up!]

As she obeys, Sabrina mutters a few incantations and the statues on either side reach for the Bruxa, grabbing her hands and immobilizing her in place. Blind and bound, she has no way to resist her fate.

$S[&#39;The time has come. You know what you must do. Choose.&#39;] She places two items next to the Altar, stepping aside for you to take her place.

Sabrina smiles at you. $S[&#39;I have just two for the moment, her and one other girl... but if the project is successful we might have more, one day.&#39;]

There&#39;s a glint in her eye that you haven&#39;t seen before. Sabrina has always seemed cheerful and somehow... nice. But you can catch a glimpse of something else under the surface now, something different. Is that Ambition for power? Pride of her accomplishments? Loyalty to Lavius? You can&#39;t quite tell, and you feel that asking directly would not serve you at the moment.

$a[&#39;Do you think I could meet her?&#39;]

Your request seems to take her almost by surprise. She cocks her head to one side, pensive. $S[&#39;Don&#39;t you have bigger fish to fry right now?&#39;]

You take a moment to compose yourself in front of the bound girl. The Bruxa is breathing heavily, her chest rising up and down under her scant clothing.

Somewhere behind you, Sabrina starts chanting again. You can feel the flow of power surge through you. Suddenly the entire temple feels alive, as if connected with you through an invisible network of blood and sinue. It flows through the statues, through the floor and into your legs and lungs and heart. Are the statues innanimate objects awakend by magic? Or are they living souls petrified in eternal service?

The thought sends a shiver down your spine, but no is not the moment for hesitation.

$A[Strength, Alexandara... Strength... and Power!]

The **Power** flows to you with each breath. Deep, primal, lustful, wild, chaotic, carnal. A thousand goddesses screaming in orgasmic pleasure as they saddle their servants, willing mouths drinking their juices before divine hips crush their skulls, mixing the blood and the bile in a cocktail fit for those who transcend morality. 

It&#39;s time for you to tap into the source. 

You look at the two objects that Sabrina has left for you.

You grab one of her breasts and press the contraption against her nipple.  Behind you, Sabrina&#39;s chanting accelerates. You can feel the primal power of the altar surgung through you. Your heart is racing. The source is opening and you are blown away by the raw energy. It&#39;s not a stream, it&#39;s a torrent. Now you understand Sabrina&#39;s words - it really is sink or swim. There is no middle ground. You either have to fall to your knees in total submission or rise above and take charge.

$Tem[Do you have what it takes?]

Your hand rises and you grab the bruxa by the throat. She makes a surprised squeal. You press the $Tem[Eternal Anguish] more firmly against her breast and feel as something begins to dig into her skin. The two statues are holding her hands firmly. She&#39;s at your disposal.

You push the door all the way and enter the machine room. There are notes scattered everywhere and tools laying across the table. A group of figures turn around, looking at you.

$rando[&#39;You shouldn&#39;t be here, doll....&#39;] 

Startled, you turn around to run, only to come face to face with a man that is vaguely familiar. He gives you a bitter grin, then swings towards your forehead.

Then the metal pipe hits you, and the world [[blacks out-&gt;t drunk 1]].

$a[&#39;Just wanted to check on you really... things have been rather crazy at The Crooked Elm lately.&#39;]

Sabrina gives a knowing nod. $S[&#39;I imagine that monster of a man has finally decided to go for it.&#39;]

For a moment you freeze, then just shrug. $A[She knows. Of course she knows. How could I ever think she didn&#39;t.] The curvy vampire is examining her nails, refusing to address the elephant in the room.

$a[&#39;I don&#39;t suppose you could-&#39;]

$S[&#39;No, I&#39;m sorry sis, I&#39;m not discussing that. He does what he does and whatever happens - happens. I&#39;ll deal with the aftermath when the time comes, but for the moment don&#39;t ask me to pick sides.&#39;]

You enter an underground passageway, similar in style and architecture to something you&#39;ve seen before. $A[How old is this place? I wonder if it&#39;s the same network of tunnels...?] You make a few mental notes at the back of your head and continue following Sabrina&#39;s echoing footsteps.

The underground passage seems to be sloping deeper and deeper down. The laboratory was already underneath the hunting hut and not it feels like you&#39;re diving deeper still. Looking at the walls, you can see light color variations between newer stones and much more ancient ones.

Eventually the passage ends with a gaping entrance that spills into a larger chamber. Sabrina waves you to follow then disappears in.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/sabrina.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
As soon as you step through the threshold, the hallway spills out into a spacious underground chamber. It&#39;s a round room that resembles an ancient temple. You can see pillars and stone statues of women bound in various explicit positions. The whole setting is bathing in waves of muted light and shadows playing on the listy curves.

$Aa[&#39;Woah....&#39;]

You can barely believe what you&#39;re seeing, it looks so different from the style of the laboratory above.

$S[&#39;Mira, come here!&#39;] echoes Sabrina&#39;s voice, interrupting your thoughts. A girl emerges from the shadows behind the statues and struts forward, falling on her knees in front of the vampire. $S[&#39;Good girl.&#39;] Sabrina gives her a pat on the head. $S[&#39;Well, there she is. Oogle away, sis.&#39;]

You turn to the Bruxa. She looks back at you, her gaze both lustful and devious, yet strangely innocent.

$a[&#39;These statues are absolutely stunning. Did you and Lavius buid this... for the Bruxas?&#39;]

$S[&#39;You flatter me, sis,&#39;] blushes Sabrina. $S[&#39;We didn&#39;t make **ALL** of it, the temple was already here, though I did have a hand in the, shall we say, decoration...&#39;]

You examine the statues again, wide-eyes with wonder. They look incredibly real, down to the ropes and chains. $a[&#39;This is simply astonishing...&#39;]

$S[&#39;I knew you&#39;d have an eye for this sort of thing.&#39;]

You turn to the altar. It is some steps away, but you can feel a soft power emanating from it. The symbols etched in the stone are far from dormant - you can swear someof the edges are gently moving in the stone, like magical seaweed trapped in the waves of this reality. Trying to focus on them creates a funny feeling at the back of your head, so you abruptly shake your gaze away and back to your new friend.

The Bruxa awaits patiently on her knees, silent and attentive.

$Mira[&#39;Of course I do! I ju-&#39;]

Sabrina slaps the girl across the face, leaving a red mark on her cheek. $S[&#39;Only when spoken to. Forgive this one, the training is still underway.&#39;]

$Mira[&#39;I&#39;m sorry mi-&#39;]

Another slap equalizes both sides and the bruxa bows her head down, returning to still silence. 

$a[&#39;Isn&#39;t that a little harsh?&#39;] you raise an eyebrow. 

$S[&#39;She is a **servant**. And I don&#39;t mean that as a decriptor of her function. It&#39;s who she **is**. Deep down, at her core. She was created to **serve**. A Bruxa needs a strong hand and a guiding authority, it&#39;s what keeps them functional. Left alone they easily spiral into maddness and start attacking random people in the forests until someone puts them out of their misery. A free Bruxa is a dead one. An obedient Bruxa is a happy one.&#39;]

Sabrina bends down, squeezing Mira&#39;s face with a hand and turning her eyes towards herself. $S[&#39;Open your legs, slut.&#39;] The girl obeys and Sabrina thrusts a boot in her crotch, rubbing it back and forth. You can feel the girl&#39;s shivers as she does her best to maintain her position as still as possible. $S[&#39;You will clean all the statues tonight, dear. Make sure they are spottless.

There&#39;s something in the young Bruxa that resonates with you and makes your heart flutter. You look into her eyes and she smiles back, licking her lips. 

$A[Am I.... crushing on her?]

The thought apepars uninvited and leaves you almost shocked. Seeing another female patiently on her knees is a novel experience. You reach out and pull her collar. Mira obediently slides forward and falls in your feet, awaiting orders.

$S[&#39;I see that you like what you see,&#39;] teases you Sabrina with a grin.

$a[&#39;She&#39;s gorgeous. I wonder if I could....&#39;]

$S[&#39;....play with her?&#39;] laughs the vampire. $S[&#39;Sure, sis. I can see that it will keep you awake at night if you miss the opportunity.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Thank you, Sabrina.&#39;]

$S[&#39;Don&#39;t mention it. While you&#39;re at it, you might as well take care of Emilia too. Come, I will show you how to train them. Bring her to the center.&#39;]

Approaching the center of the round room, Sabrina calls out another name and a second Bruxa emerges from somewhere, falling meekly at her mistress&#39; feet.

$S[&#39;This is Emilie. She&#39;s a bit shy, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get along splendidly. Now, pay attention.&#39;]

Sabrina flicks her crop, pushing the girl&#39;s chin up with the tip. $S[&#39;Emilie, fix my straps.&#39;]

Immediately, the girl springs up and begins methodically going through each and every one of Sabrina&#39;s straps and belts, loosening and tightening them to make sure that the tension is even on all sides. After a few minutes she kneels again, awaiting further instructions.

$S[&#39;Good girl. Drink.&#39;] Extending her wrist, Sabrina offers it to the Bruxa, who bites eagerly, suckling a few drops of blood down her throart. $S[&#39;That&#39;s enough.&#39;]

Turning to you, Sabrina shows the two small openings on her wrist. $S[&#39;Feeding them after a task well done reinforces the bond. It doesn&#39;t have to be much, but consistency is the key. And of course if the task wasn&#39;t well done - well it&#39;s up to you to figure out a punishment. Don&#39;t hold back. Would you like to try?&#39;]

You reach out and gently caress Mira on her cheek. She nuzzles in your hand, just like a puppy.

$a[You misspoke yet again during the ritual, Mira. It is not the first time. I think you and I both know you deserve to be punished.&#39;]

You lean in and kiss her, then take a deep breath. $a[&#39;Let this device show you the depths of longing and desire. Let your flower be sealed now and you never know the height of another climax. You will learn new pleasures and new purpose. You will obey all orders and your yearning lips will clean my boots, your gaping ass will take all eagerly, and your soul will seek sollace in knowing that this is your rightful place, the only way to cleanse yourself of all disobedience.&#39;]

$Tem[Let it be so]

The power bursts out and the $Tem[Eternal Anguish] digs deeper and deeper, permanently lodging itself. Its magical power fuses with her body, inflicting a condition of never ending lust and arousal, and placing a seal between her legs.

$Mira[&#39;N-no-&#39;] the bruxa bursts into sob, falling against your chest. $Mira[&#39;Why mistress.....&#39;]

 $a[&#39;Hush now, dear. It is the only way.&#39;] You smile, your $in[black wings] gently wrapping over her.

Your $in[wings].

You snap out of the frenzy to a slow clap.

You acquiesce and Sabrina spins around, rubbing her hands happily. $S[&#39;I do so love training new slaves!&#39;]

$a[&#39;Hey, I&#39;m not a slave!&#39;] you cut her off, pouting.

$S[&#39;I know, I know, sis... but the idea&#39;s the same. You will see. Now - time to get serious.&#39;] She flicks her crop and in a moment the giddy schoolgirl is wiped off her face and you see a deeper level of Sabrina - a mischievous shine in her eye and an energy in her posture. $S[&#39;For this exercise, you will keep your clothes on... at least some of them. Come, kneel here.&#39;]

She taps a spot on the floor, her words allowing for no objection. 

You take your spot dutifully and look up at her. There is a tension building in the air. You can feel anticipation running down your spine, sweet and electric. The curvy vampire always has such sweet delights in store for you.

$S[&#39;Good girl. Now, take your tits out for me!&#39;]

You smile at her and (link-reveal:&quot;obey.&quot;)[&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/servitude2.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;  width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;

Ionut turns your back to you and for a moment his shoulders slump down. He seems tired and somehow... angry. It&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve seen him like this.

You mull over the situation in your mind. $A[I really need to get a hold of these keys....]

It seems that the usual approach is not working here. You try to glimpse what may be happening in his head. You place a hand on his shoulder.

Ionut&#39;s hand suddenly grabs your wrist, his large bulbous fingers steady as iron. $Io[&#39;Miss Alexandra, do you &#39;ave a jar of worms?&#39;] 

You look up at Ionut. At the edge of his thin, dead lips, there is the faint beginning of a grin.

$a[&#39;You underestimate me, Ionut!&#39;] you wink at him. $a[&#39;So, what now?&#39;]

For a moment, Ionut falls silent. If you didn&#39;t know better, you&#39;d almost swear that the pale skin on his cheeks looks ever so slighlty red. The moment stretches, then he speaks slowly: $Io[&#39;Earlier, you ovvered a favor...&#39;]

You can see that he&#39;s thinking about something. $A[Now&#39;s my chance to convince him!] You place a hand on his shoulder. It&#39;s friendly. Even more than just friendly.

$a[&#39;Yes, Ionut. If I need your keys. I need your help. But we can help each other. Just let me know how I can be.... *useful*&#39;] you look straight up at him, biting your lip and arching your back to give him a better view of your $breasts.

Now you can tell that he&#39;s deffinitely blushing.

$Io[&#39;Come vith me,&#39;] he says simply, then heads to the back of the kitchen. He opens a small door and you can see a tiny closet with shelves and other supplies. It&#39;s very dark.

$S[&#39;Good. I see that you&#39;re in exactly the right condition to be... receptive.&#39;]

You blush a little, still holding her gaze.

$S[&#39;Now, let&#39;s get started.&#39;] She rubs her chin thoughtfully. $S[&#39;Thinking about everything you&#39;ve said do far, what you really need to understand, sis, is the concept of **servitude**.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Servitude?&#39;]

$S[&#39;Yes. It is an important part of a submissive&#39;s repertoire, but it is different from submission itself. Do you understand why?&#39;]

Her finger moves towards your mouth, tracing a circle around it before running over your lips and prying them gently apart. You can feel your breath coming in shorter, small beads of sweat covering your blushing face.

$a[&#39;This is for you, Sabrina,&#39;] you say in a quiet voice without breaking eye contact. Your hand slips between your legs and your finger rubs the moist entrance to your pussy. A wave of pleasure spreads almost immediately.

Sabrina waits silently, observing. You continue the exercise, letting your hips sway genly back and forth as you begin rubbing yourself.

$a[&#39;A-ah~&#39;] The soft moan escapes your lips almost involuntarily. Then you wrap your mouth around her finger and begin sucking it. It is soft and warm in your mouth and feels just *right*.

Then you feel it coming. The embers of pleasure, kindling brighter and hotter. A ball in your tummy that grows with every movement of your fingers, every caress of your swelling bud.

Invlunatarily, your hips begin rocking desperately, searching for something to rub against. Your needy pussy is so very close to release, you can feel it burning and screaming for something to touch it. 

You keep your hands apart, letting this ridiculous and desperate dance run its course, until your body can finally stay still again. Sabrina takes out her finger with growing pride in her eyes.

$S[&#39;Well done, sis! You knew exactly what would please me - excellent choice! I&#39;m always a sucker for frustrated little bitches. Now, I have a little reward for you - I think you&#39;ve earned it. Are you ready?&#39;]

You lean in and bury your face in her breasts, licking them sensually. For a moment there isn&#39;t much of a reaction, then Sabrina gently but firmly pushes you backwards.

$S[&#39;No! You can&#39;t just touch without permission. Bad girl!&#39;]

You nod your hed eagerly, happy to receive Sabrina&#39;s praise.

The vampire turns around and goes to her trunk, rummaging it for a few moments before returning to you with a smile.

$S[&#39;I understand that you must be **terribly** frustrated after that little exercise, sis. So I brought something for you.&#39;]

She lifts her hand, presenting two small jars, one blue and one red.

$S[&#39;This blue cream here is cool and soothing, and also has a light numbing effect. If you want to apply some of it not only will it save you from the current *heat*, but it will provide some extra protection for a while, in case you get yourself in any sticky situations.&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/servitude2.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;  width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;

$a[&#39;W-what about this one....?&#39;]

Sabrina&#39;s smile widens. $S[&#39;This is something I made myself, and I&#39;m very proud of it! It creates a long-lasting, stimulating sensation. It feels absolutely amazing on some places. The only unfortunate side effect is that you won&#39;t be able to cum for a while. So very, very sad.&#39;]

You hesitate for a moment. You thought that you had already passed her little training. Is this a genuine choice? And what do you *really* want to apply?

You feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the whole ordeal. Your finger dips in the blue jar. The cream feels nice and cool on your skin. Sabrina sighs.

$S[&#39;I suppose I shouldn&#39;t place my hopes too high...&#39;]

You feel like you&#39;ve failed her somehow, but it&#39;s too late. Your pussy is already on fire and you just need to find some relief. You scoop up a generoud amount and glid your hand along your slit, coating it with a thick layer of the soothing substance. The flames of passion quickly subside and the pent up tension in your body washes away, giving place to a calmer warmth.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/servitude2.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;  width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;
$a[&#39;Damn, this feels good...&#39;]

You let the relief wash over you and your body naturally leans farward, falling into Sabrina&#39;s embrace. She wraps her hands around you, allowing for a moment of respite where you can collect your thoughts. It feels so nice that you are not rushing to end it, and she seems willing to give you the time you need.

$a[&#39;Thank you, Sabrina...&#39;]

$S[&#39;You&#39;re welcome, sis. You did well.&#39;]

Her words of affirmation chase away your fears that you somehow disappointed her with your performance. Perhaps you could have done even better, but right now this feels like it&#39;s enough. You cuddle into her even tighter, basking in the warmth and tenderness of her immortal body.

There is something in the sweet frustration that you are currently feeling. The embers are already starting to calm down, but still burning hot. And they could burn much hotter.

Your hand hovers over the the jars while you&#39;re holding Sabrina&#39;s gaze. Slowly, you dip your finger in the red jar. The cream feels hot on your skin. Sabrina&#39;s eyes shine.

$S[&#39;Go on, sis.&#39;]

Your hand moves down in slow motion. Your legs apart, knees firmly on the ground. You take a deep breath. Your fingers push away your folds and your index coats a line of the cream right on top of your clit. The flames of desire are immediately fanned higher, the heat spreading upwards to your belly.

$a[&#39;Aaaaahhh~~~&#39;]

$S[&#39;Good. You are such a good girl, sis. Here, let me help you.&#39;]

Sabrina kneels down in front of you, her face close to yours. She grabs your hand in hers and moves it back up, towards the jar. You can only look with helplessness and admiration as she forces your entire hand into the jar, smearing cream over all of your fingers and your palm.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/servitude2.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;  width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;
$S[&#39;This should do it. It is what you wanted, right sis? To please me?&#39;]

You give a small nod.

Sbarina moves your hand down again, between your legs. The cream is dripping thick. Her face is getting closer, her velvet lips parting to meet yours. $S[&#39;Be a good little bitch in heat now, sis.&#39;]

You sink in the kiss and press your palm to your pussy, smearing a thick load all over it. Every inch of your skin explodes with yearning. The two of you, hand in hand, continue rubbing and smearing it to make sure no spot is missed. Then the desire becomes overwhelming and you fall forward in her arms, your entire body shaking.

$S[&#39;There, there sis,&#39;] she pushes away a strand of hair. $S[&#39;You did great. I&#39;m so proud of you.&#39;]

You slip into the small space and Ionut slides in after you, closing the door. It&#39;s suddenly very dark, the sounds of the Crooked Elm muffled and distant. You can feel more so than see Ionut&#39;s presence beside you - big, imposing, odd. He smells of meat and soil and something else which you can&#39;t quite define.

$A[Seems like no one will disturb is in here....]

Just as the thought finishes in your head, you can feel Ionut bending down in front of you. His head is somewhere around your chest level and his arms wrap around you, fumbling with your clothes. As you feel his fingers slip under the fabric you take note yet again just how unnaturally massive his hands are. They make you feel like a small thing in his iron grip, like a bird among the grasp of a giant.

Ionut slides down your panties and you feel a moist spot beginning to develop between your legs. This is not your usual idea of seduction, but there&#39;s something so weird and enticing about the whole situation.

There is a strange movement and a sound of something opening. Then a smell of soil and decay fills the small room and you feel a new (link-reveal:&quot;wetness between your legs.&quot;)[(show:?worms)

It takes you a moment to process what is happening. The jar. The worms. Ionut&#39;s lumpy fingers around your small waist.

Your lips part and you accept the servant&#39;s advances. His jaw is much larger than yours and you can feel his leathery skin rub against your face, something about it feeling not entirely human.

Your chest is pounding like a church bell as you struggle to get a hold of the situation. Feelings of revulsion and arousal are mixed in a morbid cocktail that is pouring down your throat and you&#39;re all too eager to swallow.

As the moment drags on you feel several forces fighting inside of you.

Of all the bad ideas you&#39;ve ever had, this has to be one of the worst. And yet, you can&#39;t help yourself.

Still kissing Ionut, you reach down and grab the strings of your underwear. You can feel the wriggling mass just under your crotch. The slime smearing against your thighs. Your open pussy, twitching in anticipation.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/worms_panties_on.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
Inch by inch, you pull your panties up. Then comes the first contact with your slit. It&#39;s cold, and wet, and repulsive. You can feel your entire body beginning to shake.

Ionut pulls away from the kiss. $Io[&#39;Miss Alexandra...&#39;] his voice is trembling with excitement. You&#39;ve never heard him like this before.

You feel like you&#39;re going to faint. Your back leaned against the wall, you pull your panties as tightly up as you can, arching your hips towards Ionut. Somehow, it seems that he&#39;s able to see in the dark, because you can feel him bend down, examing.

$Io[&#39;It&#39;s beautivul...&#39;] he traces a finger on the outside of your crotch, pressing the wriggling mass against your skin,

$a[&#39;Aaaahhhh~~~&#39;]

You can no longer contain yourself. You fall down to your knees, panting and sweating. Your skin is burning. Your heart is racing. Your slit is being caressed by the slimy abominations.

Very gently, Ionut is holding you, like some kind of lost and fragile treasure. You are astounded by the amount of care from those big, lumpy hands. $A[Is he being.... tender?]

The worms continue to wriggle and you can feel your head beginning to turn.

$A[Really, Ionut....?]

You sigh. There&#39;s probably a reason why he&#39;s using these, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less disgusting. You take the fishing pole and carefully attach one of the fingers to the hook.

You throw the line in and wait. The air at the cemetery is cool but pleasant and minutes pass with relative ease. While you are a little anxious about the clock ticking, it&#39;s also nice to be away from it all, if only for a moment.

After a while, you feel a subtle rumble of the ground beneath you. $A[Something is coming....]

There&#39;s a sound of dirt moving around and suddenly the line of your rod is pulled down to the depths of the grave. The jank is followed by another, and another, culminating in chaotic wriggling that you can feel all the way up your arm.

You pull the lure in, lifting a giant wriggling mass of dark worms, clustered around your bait. The sight of your prize incites revulsion, as well as morbid fascination.

$A[Try not to think about it, try not to think about it....]

You carefully move the ball of worms over the empty jar and lower them inside, closing the lid.

$A[This should do it!]

Looking through the glass, you can see the slimy creatures coiling around one another. They are much larger than regular worms and have something... unnatural about them.

Now you can tell that he&#39;s deffinitely blushing.

$Io[&#39;Come vith me,&#39;] he says simply, then heads to the back of the kitchen. He opens a small door and you can see a tiny closet with shelves and other supplies. It&#39;s very dark.

Up close you can see that the worms are long and thick, with pitch-black slimy bodies.

You swing the string towards the bucket, but your movement is too abrupt and a few worms fall off, splashing directly in your cleavage.

$a[&#39;Eeek!&#39;]

You shriek and try to shake them off, but they wiggle down between your breasts and under your clothes.

You feel an adrenaline rush with a mixture of revulsion and morbid curiosity. There&#39;s no way to pull them out one by one, you&#39;d need to remove your $suit for that. The only question is whether to do it right now in the rain and front of Ionut, or wait until you&#39;re back at the hotel...

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/worms_panties_on.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
It takes some effort to focus, let alone speak. But you do feel the earth. The dark, damp soil which has spawned the horrors that currently slither between your legs. You can&#39;t quite explain how, but it&#39;s almost as if you can *taste* them, a bitter taste of mud and decay.

$a[&#39;Y-yes....&#39;] you manage. $a[&#39;I can feel it....&#39;]

The servant&#39;s body is somehow even closer. You can feel his massive, irregular torso pressing against yours. It&#39;s oddly comforting, even arousing. 

$a[&#39;Ionut...&#39;] you whisper.

$Io[&#39;Yes, Miss Alexandra?&#39;]

You open your mouth and find you don&#39;t know what to say. It is quite extraordinary to find someone who so openly shares this fascination with the grotesque, someone who will not judge you for these despicable delights. You feel a light $A[rush of euphoria] and the unmistakable desire to do very unwise things.

How much further could you go? You bite your lip and glide your hand down Ionut&#39;s suit. It comes to rest insticntively on a hard bulge poking in his pants. You are about to do very foolish things indeed.

As the worms keep wriggling in your panties you press yourself tighter against Ionut. $A[To hell with it...] You grab one of his hands and not-so-subtly guide it down your pants.

Just as expected, Ionut doesn&#39;t seem to mind the worms. In fact, after a moment of surprised stupor, he accepts your invitation with eagerness that borders on exhiliration.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/worms_panties_on.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;

$a[&#39;~Aaahhhhh~&#39;] the moan escapes your lips as those giant, lumpy fingers glide along your slit and then slip inside. Soft tremors shake your body as the warmth of your juices mixes with the cold slime of the worms. You press even more tightly against Ionut and unbuckle his pants, letting the bulge peak out into a giant and mishapen instrument of pleasure.

Your mind is drawing blank at this point and you&#39;re going by pure instinct. You begin stroking him slowly and picking up the pace as satisfied groans and grumbles escape the servant&#39;s lips. Before long the motions of his fingers between your legs are completely in synch with your gentle hand stroking his giant cock, the two of you dancing in unison, talking without words. Ionut slips another finger inside of you, forcing your pussy to stretch and open to accommodate the new width.

The $A[euphoria] in your mind escalates and erupts into maddness and lust, into the pure desire to transgress all limits and desacrate all boundaries. Your hand strokes faster and faster until you feel Ionut&#39;s giant member stiffen as a rock, long and hard and twitching on the verge of explosion.

The servant grabs you roughly. $Io[&#39;V-vorgive me...&#39;] His fingers abruptly slide out of you, leaving a gaping wet hole screaming for attention. You can feel him mastefully keeping your slit open and pressing you down against the wriggling mass of the worms. Seizing the opportunity, one of them slips inside, slithering its way deeper inside of you.

Your mind explodes and all inhibitions disintegrate. You lower your head and wrap your lips around the servant&#39;s cock. His fingers push the worm deeper inside your pussy and he goes over the edge with a groan, a burst of thick fluid filling your mouth.

You eagerly gulp down Ionut&#39;s seed, cherishing it as the most esquisite of delicacies. It slides down your throat like a thick nectar, making place for more bursts and spurts as Ionut&#39;s groans follow fresh loads oozing out of his cock.

The worms continue slithering in your panties and one of them, helped by Ionut, is making its way deeper and deeper into your pussy. You feel a strange fire just above, like a hungry abyss opening its mouth to welcome it.

$A[Could it.... possibly....?]

It can&#39;t be. A part of your mind refuses to believe the implications, even as another one is already bracing for the inevitable. The worm slithers even deeper inside. It is the strangest of feelings. Not like something violating you, but as if you yourself are luring it in. Waiting. Expecting. Anticipating.

You swallow hard. Why should you refuse a gift when it&#39;s offered?

You can&#39;t see if Ionut is blushing in the darkness, but you can definitely feel his boner poking at you.

$Io[&#39;No...&#39;] he says slowly. $Io[&#39;No one likes... the vurms...&#39;]

You think you understand what&#39;s driving Ionut crazy. It&#39;s more than just the worms. It&#39;s the worms on **you**. A beautiful girl, an elegant succubus, a near perfect body giving in to the filth and uglyness of the creatures. It&#39;s downright grotesque. Unthinkable. Sacriligeous.

Your heart is racing, but you hold steady, waiting for the servant to make his move. Then, you can feel his hand pressing agaisnt your folds, a fistful of worms squirming between his fingers.

You flinch, but only for a moment. The cold slime is thrust deeper and deeper, as Ionut&#39;s hand stretches your pussy open. It&#39;s so wrong. Your mind is going crazy.

$a[&#39;Y-y-yeeeesssss&#39;] you squeal, feeling the grotesque ball sinking deeper. Drool is coming down your lips. Ionut pushes again and some of the worms slither deeper still, sinking one by one into your innards.

You grab Ionut&#39;s bulge with one hand and take out his cock, already erect, and begin stroking it encouragingly. His hand twists and turns, stretching you wider, eased by the dark slime as well as your own juices.

Ionut groans and prematurely explodes, spraying thick white seed all over your body. You quickly react, placing your mouth over him, and managing to catch the next few spurts just as they come.

As you lay on the grave in a dramatic pose, you take a moment to consider the beauty of decay. It&#39;s a thought that has recently become much more vivid in your mind, especially since you&#39;ve found pleasures in... *unusual* places.

$A[If I died right here and now, how many monsters would have their way with my corpse before it turns cold... and how many after?]

Flashes of your most memorable encounters come uninvited in your mind and your hand slips between your legs, rubbing your wet slit. There is something oddly comforting about it, something you can&#39;t quite put your finger on.

Whatever happens to you is... beautiful, in a way. There is beauty in life, such like there is beauty in death. And even if you end up torn to shreds, there will be beauty in that, too.

The unusual line of thinking helps to calm down your $a[hunger] somewhat and you feel your urges subsiding. However it is not a healthy approach for the mind. You can feel a small portion of your $clarity[sanity] withering away as you embrace the splendor of your demise.

As you lay on the grave in a dramatic pose, you take a moment to contemplate your potential immortality. It&#39;s something that you dare not really dream about, and yet... it is *exciting* to consider.

$A[If I could really live forever... what would that mean? What would it do to my body... and mind?]

It&#39;s fascinating to think about death as something that&#39;s part of your existence, rather than the final point of it. The philosophical implications are staggering. But it&#39;s also quite scary. 

You consider how much you&#39;ve changed in the the last days, or however you can measure the time passed. Your mind has already sunk into the jaws of lust and debauchery, and you&#39;re barely even starting. What would a few centuries of this bring?

The unusual line of thinking helps to clear your mind a little bit. Thinking rationally has always calmed you down and you feel as if a portion of your $clarity[sanity] is returning. At the sam time, the prospect of being plunged into lust over and over again and all the new things that await you is definitely wetting your appetite for all the obscene debauchery you can indulge in, all the while keeping on living.

The moment is surreal. You calm down your body and mind, slowly regaining your composure.

He extends a hand, dangling the keychain. You take them carefully. As the door of the closet opens, letting light back in, the two of you spend a moment just staring at each other, two twisted souls, bound by the darkest of desires.

You give Ionut a meaningful smile and whipe a bit of his cum off your lips.

$a[&#39;What kind of proposition?&#39;] you whisper between the bars. 

Lavius is very close now. His hand moves down from your waist to the voluptous curves of your ass. The whole thing feels almost natural to you now, just another part of being a succubus.

$L[&#39;I know the situation looks a bit dire, but it is not yet too late to set things straight. Think about it! Do you think the Elder will just let you go now that he&#39;s awakened? Now that you&#39;ve seen so much? No. he will keep you as a servant - or worse - and you will never leave this place. That is, unless you help me.&#39;]

Lavius&#39; lips stretch into a thin smile as he continues gazing into your eyes. You try to think quickly, and decide that you gain nothing from not knowing.

$a[&#39;What do you want me to do?&#39;]

Lavius suddenly pulls you even closer, the bars digging into your breasts as he leans to whisper in your ear. $L[&#39;Listen carefully, demon. The Elder will summon everyone at a trial tonight. It won&#39;t be about justice, but about **strength**. To remind everyone what happens to those who oppose him. So he won&#39;t just keep me in these chains&#39;] - lavius rattles the shackles binding him to the cage - $L[&#39;No, the old bastard will free me so he can execute me in a &quot;fair&quot; fight.

$L[&#39;Rest assured, my dear succubus, that he **will** unchain me. That&#39;s just how he is. Old fashioned. Brutal. Mercyless. Any victory against a tied man would be no victory at all. And let&#39;s be frank - I stand no chance against him in a fair fight...&#39;]

$L[&#39;Indeed he is. It won&#39;t be easy.&#39;] Lavius gives a meaningful pause. $L[&#39;My original plan was so beautiful, you know. Using science to vanquish him. The one thing he never understood, never **wanted** to understand. Alas, **someone** intervened.&#39;]

$a[&#39;I&#39;m not going to apologise for that, Lavius. My own life comes first.&#39;]

$L[&#39;So it does. I understand.&#39;]

There is another, longer, silence. His hand is still casually resting on your hips.

$L[&#39;I thought all night of what possibilities remain. And, given the circumstances, I think there&#39;s only one - poison.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Poison? Why didn&#39;t you do that from the start then?&#39;]

$L[&#39;Ah, but you forget that his tower is well guarded. And he was in hybernation to begin with. And then it needs to come from someone he trusts. Luckily, you&#39;ve stepped into the picture.&#39;] He winks at you and his grip becomes firmer. $L[&#39;I trust that you understand that this is to our mutual interest, dear Alexandra. I trust that you understand that this is the only way if you want to be anything other than a slave. Once I defeat Vasil in battle, in front of the entire domain, I shall take his place and remake the rules. And you will be free to leave.... or stay by my side, should you choose.&#39;]

His fingers dig into your skin, pulling you even closer. His lips curl into a smile, just inches from yours. $L[&#39;Go into the forest, past the cemetery. There is a swamp there, you need but follow the stench. Once you&#39;re in the swamp, you must find a flower called a Blightbloom. You will recognize it by its strange and deathly look.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Deathly look?&#39;]

$L[&#39;Do not worry, my dear, you will know. Once you have a blightbloom, simply squeeze the juice into his wine. It won&#39;t be enough to kill him, but it will weaken him significantly. I shall take care of the rest.&#39;]

As the buzzing of insects reaches its peak, you see a strange structure among the woods. The air is thick and heavy. Even from afar, you feel a magical aura emanating from it.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Approach the structure-&gt;Altar Wishes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2232" name="Altar Wishes" tags="totem" position="11375,9150" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-SWAMP-]&lt;/div&gt;

You cross a few more suspicious puddles and carefully thread your way up a hill covered with progressively more bones and carcasses. At last you emerge at the top, finding yourself face to face with.... *something*.

$A[What the hell.....?]

The totem is perched on a small hill surrounded by a body of water. You can see several heads carved out of wood and stone, their animalistic faces staring at you with various emotions. At the top there is a $in[crescent moon], glowing softy. You can see numerous vines attached to it and stretching to the surrounding trees, from which various bones, glyphs and trinkets are hanging.

The bones rustle in the wind. The faces remain still, though you can almost feel their attention turned towards you.

(if: $task_wish is 0)[You&#39;re not quite certain what to make of this. The place is eerie and unsettling. You can feel raw magical power dripping from the air and the surrounded waters, but you have no idea how to harness or make anything useful out of it.

You climb up the floors of The Crooked Elm, reaching the attic and then approaching the Elder&#39;s Tower. This time the door is unlocked and open - a clear sign that things are changing.

$A[I guess his slumber is over now....]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/environments/attic_door.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; &gt;
As you climb the staircase, you feel a little trepidation of seeing the Elder again. You pledged your service to him when it seemed like the only reasonable option for survival. Now.... 

You mull over your choices. Vasil Petrescu remains an enigma, though some of the pieces are beginning to come together. Powerful. Merciless. A true Lord of his domain. He seems to know exactly how you fit into his plans. The only question remaining is if you agree.

You push down your anxiety and spread your wings in the darkness. Your tail swings as you count the stairs. You are a demon now. You can handle this.

Entering the top of the tower, the Elder is sitting on his throne of skulls, expecting you. His flaming eyes pierce through you as he extends a hand, beckoning you forward.

The Elder&#39;s voice is much clearer and more articulate than before. He still looks more like a monster than a human, but you feel subtle changes in his features.

$R[&#39;I will introduce you as my new wife.&#39;] The Elder pauses, his flaming red eyes staring at you calmly. His voice is iron. Steady. It is not a request, it&#39;s not an order. Just a statement. 

The haird on your back stand up. The meaning of the words sinks into your mind. 

$a[&#39;W-w-wife....?!&#39;]

$R[&#39;Lavius is right about one thing,&#39;] the Elder continues, ignoring your squeal. $R[&#39;Things have grown stale and the Dominon has grown restless. It&#39;s time for change, and for new blood. You will bear me a new son and the Petrescu bloodline will expand once again, re-affirming our control.&#39;]

You can&#39;t believe what&#39;s happening, it&#39;s all too fast, too soon. You had other plans, plans of turning back to a man, or plans of ending with someone else... And yet, now, basking in the power of the Elder, you find yourself incapable of anything but submitting to his supreme authority.

$R[&#39;Which leaves is with just one matter to settle...&#39;]

The Elder raises from his throne and steps towards you.

$a[&#39;My Lord?&#39;]

$R[&#39;This will be a mere trifle for you, demon. But I **must** make sure, now. It would be foolish to make such an announcement and then have things go awray. A ruler cannot leave his image to chance.&#39;]

$a[&#39;W-what do you mean?&#39;]

The Elder is closer now. He smiles at you, then grabs you and flips you around, pushing you down against the floor.

$R[&#39;You know this already, demon, but it is exceedingly rare for mere mortals to withstand the forces of becomming a vessel for someone like me.&#39;] He gestures broadly around to the piles of skulls. $R[&#39;Even getting Mihai has required a lot of- shall we say trial and error.&#39;]

A chill runs down your spine as your eyes meet the sockets of an empty skull.

$R[&#39;I strongly suspect that a succubus like you will be powerful enough for this purpose... but I have to make sure, before announcing my decision. So we shall perform a test, now. Spread your legs.&#39;]

With little choice, you move your legs apart, feeling yet again like a deer caught in the headlights. The Elder grabs your tail and lifts it up, caressing the black fur - a strange new sensation.

$R[&#39;Do not fear your destiny, girl,&#39;] comes his voice from behind. $R[&#39;You will have a wonderful life by my side. You will find that I can be quite generous, with those who please me. Know your place, and we shall get along wonderfully...&#39;]

And with that, he is on top of you. You can feel his weight pressing down, his claws holding your arms, his talons pushing your legs to the very limit of their possible angle, making your ass raise up and your pussy gape open, ready for penetration.

As he slides in you moan loudly, a purer and more primal sound than has ever escaped your lips. Your nails dig into the floor and your toes curl up as thrust after thrust break down and remake you into something new.

$a[&#39;Aaahh~ Whaaa~&#39;]

Another thrust shuts you up. He is deeper inside you now, stretching you, posessing you, commanding you. Your juices drip, lubricating his enormous shaft and allowing him to slip to the brink, and beyond. You can feel something deep inside you trembling in euphoria and terror.

Gates that you did not know existed shatter. The skulls turn towards you, empty sockets staring. The Elder&#39;s Seed spills inside your womb, thicker and more tangible than anything.

You shiver and shake uncontrollably, a raw power running through your veins, through your mind, through your core.

Your womb pulsates, burning like a star, ancient and unspeakable magic washing over you in its purest form. You physically feel one of your eggs being released, surrendering, and being taken.

$a[&#39;Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh~~~!!!!&#39;]

You scream, you howl, you kick and flay, but the Elder is holding you firmly. You feel the egg beginning to grow inside you, taking shape, swelling your belly. Your eyes roll up and drool drips from your lips.

The $R[thing] inside you is expanding at an incredible rate. It&#39;s drawing on your energy, your magic, transforming into something beautiful and terrible, nested deep within your belly.

And then, you break again.

Something snaps, your essence already stretched to its farthest limits. The chaos intensifies, out of control, and your body begins to spasm, flesh and bones screaming in agony.

$R[&#39;It seems I was wrong,&#39;] comes a distant voice. $R[&#39;What a shame...&#39;]

The $R[thing] inside you continues to expand violently, but the shape is **wrong**. You can feel it screaming inside of you as the magic burns away at your flesh. Pleasure turns into pain and terror.

$a[&#39;P-please....&#39;] you manage barely, the words forced out of your shaking lips.

There is something pulling you towards the center, something powerful, and ancient, unknown yet strangely familiar.

As you are pulled into the vortex, you feel the sands of time around you, shifting, falling, twisting and reversing into an ebb and flow that is beyond comprehension.

Suddenly you hear footsteps, and a giant figure descends down the stairs.

$R[&#39;**ᚠᚢᚦᚨᚱ • ᚽ ●⬤● ᚽ • ᛟᚩᛥᚡ • ᚽ ●⬤● ᚽ • ᛪᚣᚥᛩ **&#39;] His voice is deep, powerful, other-worldly. The air becomes thick and heavy. All hope seems lost. The Elder thrusts inside you and pleasure floods your mind, even as you know the inevitable end to this experiement.

$a[&#39;Aaahh~&#39;] you moan, and your mind becomes blank. What to do? Can you even do anything?

$R[&#39;**ᚠᚢᚦᚨᚱ • ᚽ ●⬤● ᚽ • ᛟᚩᛥᚡ • ᚽ ●⬤● ᚽ • ᛪᚣᚥᛩ **&#39;] Another thrust shuts you up. He is deeper inside you now, stretching you, posessing you, commanding you. Your juices drip, lubricating his enormous shaft and allowing him to slip to the brink, and beyond. 

The room is spinning, the empty eyes looking at the next victim to join the piles of skulls.

You climb up the floors of The Crooked Elm, following the Elder up the stairs all the way to his tower. This time the door is unlocked and open - a clear sign that things are changing.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/environments/attic_door.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; &gt;
As you climb the staircase behind him, you feel a little trepidation of what is about to come. You pledged your service to the vampire when it seemed like the only reasonable option for survival. Now.... 

You mull over your choices. Vasil Petrescu remains an enigma, though some of the pieces are beginning to come together. Powerful. Merciless. A true Lord of his domain. He seems to know exactly how you fit into his plans. The only question remaining is if you agree.

You push down your anxiety and spread your wings in the darkness. Your tail swings as you count the stairs. You are a demon now. You can handle this.

$R[&#39;Come, my loyal servant. Today is a day of victory! Todat, we celebrate.&#39;]

The Elder&#39;s voice is much clearer and more articulate than before. Now that you look closer, he still looks more like a monster than a human, but you feel subtle changes in his features.

You try to push him away, to fight, to resist, but it&#39;s no use. Your womb pulsates, burning like a star, ancient and unspeakable magic washing over you in its purest form. You physically feel one of your eggs being released, surrendering, and being taken.

$a[&#39;Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh~~~!!!!&#39;]

You scream, you howl, you kick and flay, but the Elder is holding you firmly. You feel the egg beginning to grow inside you, taking shape, swelling your belly. Your eyes roll up and drool drips from your lips.

The $R[thing] inside you is expanding at an incredible rate. It&#39;s drawing on your energy, your magic, transforming into something beautiful and terrible, nested deep within your belly.

And then, you break again.

Something snaps, your essence already stretched to its farthest limits. The chaos intensifies, out of control, and your body begins to spasm, flesh and bones screaming in agony.

$R[&#39;It seems I was wrong,&#39;] comes a distant voice. $R[&#39;What a shame...&#39;]

The $R[thing] inside you continues to expand violently, but the shape is **wrong**. You can feel it screaming inside of you as the magic burns away at your flesh. Pleasure turns into pain and terror.

$a[&#39;P-please....&#39;] you manage barely, the words forced out of your shaking lips.

Your womb pulsates, swollen with anticipation. You physically feel one of your eggs being released, surrendering, and being taken.

$a[&#39;Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh~~~!!!!&#39;]

You feel the egg beginning to grow inside you, taking shape, swelling your belly. You give in to the pleasure, eyes rolling up and pussy tightening around the monstrous member inside you. You can feel your body and mind breaking, not withstanding the magic, not being ready for this. You know what&#39;s going to happen.

And it&#39;s driving you crazy. 

$R[&#39;Something&#39;s wrong,&#39;] hisses the Elder. $R[&#39;You can&#39;t possibly...&#39;]

You&#39;re not listening to him. Reason, decency, pretense - nothing matters. Your hips are thrusting harder and harder as your belly swells uncontrollably, flesh being consumed by the runaway power of the ancient magic.

You shake in both pleasure and pain, fucking in a frenzy as your sanity disintegrates.

$a[&#39;Aaaaaaahhhhh~~~!!!!&#39;]

Your muscles are barely obeying you know, and yet you keep going, keep grinding. Death is near. Your pussy quivers and you shake in an unholy climax, as the last of your energies are syphoned away.

$M[&#39;While you were busy dealing with monsters, I did some reading. Succubus lore is truly fascinating stuff you know. It turns out the process can be reversed, but you will need to perform The True Wish ritual.&#39;]

$M[&#39;I know how it sounds, but I believe it could work, as long as you have all the necessary components.&#39;]

$M[&#39;Not quite **that** impossible, silly. You will need just 4 things.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Fine. Tell me already.&#39;] 

$M[&#39;First, the right words. Luckily for you, I&#39;ve managed to find them, so you just have to remember them. Then, the right catalyst. I have a few ideas that could work. Third, enough magical power to fuel it. And lastly, the core ingredient, which you can probably guess....&#39;]

$M[&#39;Impatient as ever, I see. Fine. I suppose there&#39;s no use in dragging this one longer than it&#39;s needed. But do remember that this was not easy, and one day I expect you to remember all that&#39;s due....&#39;]

$a[&#39;Of course. You know I&#39;m a woman of my word.&#39;]

The cat smirks and begins reciting. The words are complex, subtle, indescribable. Even with your knowledge of the occult, they&#39;re particularly difficult to grasp, let alone remember.

$M[&#39;There are many places of great power around here. So truly, we have some choice. But still...&#39;]

$a[&#39;Still?&#39;]

$M[&#39;If you want to be successful, it&#39;s best to use a place designed for such purposes. There is an ancient totem in the forest, not too far from The Crooked Elm. Long before the Petrescus came to this lands the villagers used it to pray to the Old Gods. It&#39;s a place of power, and more importantly - a place designed to harness power. It should be the perfect location for a ritual like this.&#39;]

$a[&#39;A totem? &#39;] you say incredulously. 

$M[&#39;These lands are old. We are not the first to call them home.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Fine. How can I find it?&#39;]

$M[&#39;It should be somewhere in the swamp. I haven&#39;t been there myself, mud isn&#39;t good for a cat, but you should be able to find it-&#39;]

$a[&#39;....just beyond the cemetery.&#39;] you finish, giving Felicia a smile back. $a[&#39;Lavius told me to look for a special flower there.&#39;]

$M[&#39;The swamp is older than the manor. Many things can be found there.&#39;] Felicia nods. $M[&#39;Just be careful. I doubt you&#39;d be the only one attracted to its power.&#39;]

$a[&#39;It&#39;s- eeh... &#39;] You pause. Who are you, exactly? Alex? Alexandra? A human? A demon? Your wings spread out around you, a corporeal reminder of what you&#39;ve become. You try to answer several times, but the words get stuck in your throat. They taste bitter, somehow *wrong*. It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re physically incapable of saying anything that you don&#39;t believe with all your heart.

$a[&#39;A doomed soul,&#39;] you manage finally. $a[&#39;I&#39;ve lost control of my fate, and am likely to die, unless something changes. And it feels beyond my control. So I&#39;ve come for help.&#39;]

$Tot[So be it....]

The heads begin spinning in oposing directions, changing faces and expressions with each turn. At last they stop in a new configuration, strange creatures staring at you.

$Tot[Speak your True Wish, o doomed soul....]

The totem&#39;s eyes begin glowing as power surges through the vines and the soil and the trees.

$Tot[Demons are creatures of lust and passion...]

$a[&#39;And so am I!&#39;] Your voice rises. $a[&#39;I cannot deny my lust and desires! I wish to do unspeakable things and to have unspeakable things done to **me**...&#39;] You trail off, as all of your memories flood your mind, a tsunami of unholy depravities that you could never in a million years imagine possible. And now you realize you want more. You want **more of it**.

$Tot[A succubus has a Master, she is rarely left on her own]

$a[&#39;I&#39;m not afraid to submit!&#39;] The confession comes out before you&#39;ve even had time to think about it. $a[&#39;I know that I will be taken, owned... and that&#39;s okay... it is what I want...]

$Tot[A succubus may have her body altered, her mind moulded, her spirit chained]

$a[&#39;I am not afraid! I will find my freedom and satisfaction in whatever is chosen for me!&#39;]

The glow intensifies as the air becomes even thicker.

$Tot[Prove it]

The ground shakes and suddenly various objects emerge from muddy cracks, littering the soil around you. They are deeply familiar, things that you&#39;re sure you have seen, though perhaps forgotten. There is $in[a pair of piercings with weights], some $in[metal chains], a strange $in[plug with a pentagram], and various other trinkets. Before you even think about it, you know what you must do.

Without even thinking, you reach for the plug with the pentagram. Its weight feels comfortable in your hands and the symbol is *just right* for its purpose. There&#39;s still mud dripping from it, but this doesn&#39;t bother you in the slightest. You are in a state of euphoria, a resolve hardening inside you that you have never felt before.

$a[&#39;This is who I am,&#39;] you say out loud, to the totem, and to yourself.

You fall to your knees and pull your panties down. The mud is cool and somehow accepting. You lean forward and then place your hands down, feeling the soil beneath your fingers. Then down again. Head to the ground. Dirt on your face. Ass up. Legs spread apart. Just how it should be.

You reach around and put the tip of the plug against your hole. You can feel your body quivering with anticipation, wanting it, **screaming** for it. You push and your tight little hole stretches willingly, begging to be forced into openness and acceptance.

$a[&#39;Mmmm~&#39;] you moan with pleasure as the plug slides in, plopping into place. It feels so damn *right*. But you want more.

You remember every wicked, dirty, abominable creature that has had its way with you and your pussy quivers with anticipation of doing it all over again, countless of times, until every walking horror that has a dick has had its way with you more times than you can count and you are left trembling and broken, with cum oozing out of every hole and a stupid grin on your face.

The $in[plug] grows again, and again, and again. With every thought, every memory, every confession of your pleasures and the depths of your depravity it stretches you further and further.

Then stretched again. And further still. 

$Tot[Manifest your will]

With absolute clarity, you realize that this is irrevirisble. This is it. No going back, no reset, no guilty pleasures fading to normal as you are transported back in time. Once your wish is fulfilled, you will survive, and be given exactly what you want.

This is it.

And in the absolute sacred honesty of your soul, you know that this is what you **deserve**.

It&#39;s not a scream of pain. Not even a scream of pleasure, not this one. It is the culmination of everything, the alpha and omega, all of the unspeakable truths of your existence merged into one. 

The plug plops out and you feel your hole gaping wide open, offering itself to the world. It will never be the same. And you will never be the same.

An electric jolt runs through your body and you feel your $in[black tail] quivering, the dark fur on it now even more natural than before; your $in[golden eyes] widen and narrow as your vision blurs then comes back into focus, crisper and more potent than ever; your $in[white horns] ache as they sprout and curve an inch more, before freezing into their final and definitive form; your $in[giant wings] flap around you, giant bones stretching leather membranes ready to propel you into the skies or lower you into the depths of the darkest abyss.

The Elder leads you to the top of the tower, sitting on his throne. Just like last time, he goes over his plans for you, his red eyes peering right through you as his aura of power washes over the room filled with the bones of his enemies and past wives.

If you had followed with Lavius&#39; plan, now would be the moment to do something about it. Poison the Elder, choose a different path. A different Master. But you didn&#39;t do it. It seems that there is only one path forward for it now.

You feel the egg beginning to grow inside you, taking shape, swelling your belly. You give in to the pleasure, eyes rolling up and pussy tightening around the monstrous member inside you. 

You cum, over and over again, fire and lust engulfing you like a mealstorm, and yet the flames do not burn, the desire does not break your mind. You ride in the eye of the storm, in perfect equilibrium.

Your womb grows and swells and then stabilizes, creating a small bulge on your tummy. As the Elder pulls out, a puddle of seed spills out of you, creating a puddle on the floor. The ancient magic reverberates around the room, then quiets down. You take a deep breath.

You brush the dusty surface with a finger and smile to yourself.

Your tail wraps around the strange skull and flings it into the air, then catches it again, holding it in front of your face for inspection. It&#39;s quite unbelievable what you can do now.

For a moment you try to say &quot;no&quot;, but then realize it would have been a lie. Deep down, the answer is &quot;yes&quot;. It has always been a &quot;yes.&quot;

Everything is perfevtly quiet and the Moon shines through the dirty windows. You realize everyone must have gone already and are probably awaiting the lord of the domain. Just as they should. And just as you should.

You stare at him for a moment, surprised. Vasil is dressed in fine robes, hanging open around his very human body. His flaming red eyes contrast against pale skin and white hair, braided in a single lock behind his head. A strange medallion adorns his chest, and you can feel a soft magical pulse coming from it.

$a[&#39;Wha...&#39;]

$R[&#39;Surprised?&#39;] he laughs, and the monstrous edge creeps back into his voice. $R[&#39;Power brings many advantages, and for tonight it is time for me to be a Lord, not a beast.&#39;]

He walks forward, opening the door to the night outside. $R[&#39;But do not worry, to fulfil my duties to you, I can take many forms. I am well aware of a succubus&#39; appetites.&#39;] He smirks and you blush, your mind feeling like an open book to him.

You follow the Elder out into the garden, then to the gates, and the woods beyond. The full moon shines above as the two of you walk in silence, following a familiar path at first, but then diverging to a side you have never followed before.

The path leads you deeper and deeper into the woods, weaving its way through meadows bathed in moonlight and dense patches of trees where the darkness of the forest gathers around you.

Unlike other times, you do not feel any fear or worry. You are walking with the most powerful creature of these lands. Nothing would dare threaten you. Looking at Vasil&#39;s stride, you see the walk of a Lord, someone who owns the soil and the trees, who has prawled every inch of his domain and asserted his will over every inhabitant.

$A[He sure is something else...]

You&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s just your imagination, but it feels like the dead branches themselves are pulling away to make way for him, least they incur his wrath.

$R[&#39;You put me in a difficult spot.&#39;] The Elder taps on his throne again, rubbing his chin. $R[&#39;Tell me, how have I wronged you?&#39;]

$E[&#39;Not you, but your son, My Lord. It has been too long since I&#39;ve had pray, tsk. My belly swells with eggs. I ache. My unborn children cry out for relief. I&#39;ve been promised permission to brood and yet every time I ask, my plea is rejected.&#39;]

The Elder stares, pensively. $R[&#39;Is this true, my son?&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;She is too uncontrollable, father. Last time I allowed her a girl, she took three. People complained. And we can&#39;t risk drawing too much suspicion from the lands beyond. She has had more than allowed last time, and now she must pay with her patience.&#39;]

$E[&#39;I have my urrgess. Tsk.&#39;]

$R[&#39;I understand the primal needs. You were wrong to overstep, but my son was foolish to punish you so. He should have saught another solution. Tell me, demon, how should we resolve this conundrum?&#39;]

Yet again, the Elder turns towards you, a faint smile on his lips.

You emerge onto a large clearing lined with hundreds of torches. There are many silhouettes gathered around among the trees. Most of them appear human, but you see strange shapes mixed among them, with features that you can&#39;t quite recognize. There is a susurrus at your arrival, and many whispers sweep the gathering like a wind.

In the center of the clearing there is a pedestal and an empty throne. Mihai and Ionut are waiting behind the throne, looking solemn.

Then, you see the two cages. A little to the side, Lavius and the Wolf are bound inside large metal boxes. Lavius looks calm and composed, while his companion is fidgetty. You can see that his human shape has been distorted and his swollen furry hands press against his shackles, his face half-wolfish with large feral eyes.

$A[Ah, the moon....]

Then you notice another thing - a large box, just behind Lavius. It is wrapped in several chains, but you immediately recognize it.

$A[Narcissa...]

The Elder walks forward and takes his place on the throne. The whispering quiets down. He looks at you and beckons you forward.

You are all too contious of the hundreds of eyes on you as you make your way to the center of the gathering and kneel at Vasil Petrescu&#39;s feet. No one dares say anything.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/elder2.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot; &gt;
$R[&#39;My dear subjects!&#39;] he speaks, his voice loud and powerful, without needing to shout. $R[&#39;Friends. Citizens. Old souls of the dawn of magic. It is good to see your faces again. I realize you must have missed me terribly.&#39;]

There is silence under the moonlight.

$R[&#39;It is good to see so many of you well and thriving. I must begin by thanking my dear son, Mihai, for holding the rains of the domain during my long slumber. I know that it must have not been an easy job, and yet I&#39;m certain he has fulfilled it with the utmost duty, as always.&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;I have done as seemed necessary, father.&#39;] comes Mihai&#39;s voice from behind. A little softer, but with a creeping edge you haven&#39;t heard before.

$R[&#39;I believe it. But still-&#39;] The Elder scans the crowd and you are certain he sees every face even from this distance, knows every soul. $R[&#39;-still there have been those among you, who have come to question the rightful rule of this domain. I have gathered you tonight to reafirm the Petrescu family&#39;s commitment to taking care of all of you and maintaining Justice and Order upon these lands.&#39;]

The silence stretches again, longer than before. You can feel the tension building up, so thick you could cut it with a knife.

$R[&#39;Bring forth the traitor!&#39;]

Ionut and Mihai step forward, walking to Lavius&#39;s cage and removing the heavy metal lock. It falls to the ground with an audible *thud*.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/elder2.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot; &gt;
$R[&#39;Come, Lavius, don&#39;t be shy!&#39;]

Lavius walks out of his cage, climbing up to the pedestal. His gaze meets yours, then looks down to the bulge of your belly, and part of his calm shatters, a glint of panic rising in his eyes.

$L[&#39;You all know I was right!&#39;] his voice echoes across the clearing. $L[&#39;The Petrescus have ruled for too long! They have grown weak, complacent, backwards! We are all prisoners here, trapped from the outside world, trapped in the past as humanity moves on without us!&#39;]

$R[&#39;Enough!&#39;] Vasil rises from his throne, the claws extending from his sleeves. $R[&#39;You did not seek my council, boy, you did not voice your reason according to the rules of this domain! I shall not raise my hand against the blood of M&#39;era for mere foolishness! But treason - that, I cannot forgive!&#39;]

It all happens in a flash, faster than the eye can see. A shadow dashing forward, long claws sharp as razors, a futile attempt, then splatters of blood as a throat is slit open from ear to ear. No one speaks a word as Lavius&#39; body falls to the ground, convulsing for a last time, then becoming perfectly still.

The Elder slowly walks back, retaking his seat.

$R[&#39;This was Justice, according to all laws, in front of all eyes. Let it be known that Lavius was a traitor, and shall be buried as such.&#39;]

Another long, thick silence.

$R[&#39;Now I shall deal with the rest of his accomplices. Bring forth the wolf!&#39;]

Another cage is unlocked and a half-human form steps forward, taking its place at the pedestal.

$R[&#39;Ahahah. Stubborn as always. No words to defend yourself? Have you grown tired of life, old friend?&#39;]

$W[&#39;What life is this?&#39;] the wolf raises his hands to the moonlight, his fur growing thicker. $W[&#39;I am neither beast nor man. I know no rest. I roam restless nights and wake up with blood in my mouth.&#39;]

$R[&#39;You are free. No chain around your neck. No men with bolts to pierce your heart. I took you in and gave you a home. Is this how you repay me?&#39;]

The wolf looks down at his feet, a shadow of shame in his eyes.

$W[&#39;I was given a way out, and I took it. But you are right, I did raise my fangs against he who once helped me. For this I shan&#39;t deny your right of justice. Old friend.&#39;]

The Elder ramains still, his fingers tapping on his ornamented throne. $R[&#39;You put me in a difficult position. Demon, do you think an old dog can learn new tricks?&#39;]

As the Elder turns towards you, you meet his flaming red eyes, then look at the wolf. Death might be a release for him, but if Lavius&#39; research is true, perhaps there are ways the werewolf could have a better future, with the right spells and a spark of science.

$R[&#39;So be it. I shall relieve you from your torment, since you wish it so much.&#39;]

You meet the werewolf&#39;s gaze again. There is saddness and peace in his eyes. He gives you a distant smile. $W[&#39;It was nice knowing you, doll. I see you&#39;ve come a long way. May immortality treat you better than it did me. So long.&#39;]

There is another flash, this time with no resistance. A head rolls down in the grass, stopping next to Lavius&#39; corpse. You swallow hard, suppressing a wave of neausea.

$R[&#39;It is a sad day, but what must be done, must be done.&#39;]

The Elder sits back on his throne, pensive. There are a few whispers that rise from the crowd, but quickly die out.

Ionut leaps forward and grabs the chained box, dragging it to the center of the clearing. There is a faint sound of swuishing water inside.

There is a deep silence. No response comes from the box.

$R[&#39;We cannot kill her, not inside her waters. But an eternal prison can be worse than death. She cannot escape.&#39;]

You look at the box, mixed emotions rising in you. You did come off on the wrong foot, and you know Narcissa would have killed you at the blink of an eye if it furthered her own plans even slightly. Yet you can&#39;t help but feel some deep sadness for the poor creature. With her lover dead and trapped in a box, she is bound for a miserable fate.

Back at the tower, the Elder sits at his throne and you kneel by his side obediently. It has been some time since you have been to the outside world, time you have spent resting and indulging in lustful delights with your new Master. Your breasts are beginning to grow and swell and the bulge on your tummy is bigger by the day.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/bad_end_elder2.jpg&quot;  width=&quot;800&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
As he casually rests a hand around your neck, you feel the comfort of his possession and you press your head on his side, ready to please any of his whims. This has quickly become your favorite place to be, your natural position. He seems to be happy to indulge your demonic urges, letting you sit naked and swollen by his side even at times of audiences with important guests. You are his wife, his whore, his prized posession, and you drip with excitement as your lips wrap around his cock, much to the amusement of his visitors.

The Elder&#39;s fingers gently caress your throat, making you quiver with anticipation for your next lustful depravities.

$R[&#39;Tell me true, demon, do you miss anything from outside my tower?&#39;]

$a[&#39;My Lord?&#39;] you raise your eyes to him, inquisitively.

$R[&#39;You have spent much of your days here. To protect our growing child, undoubtedly. But after he is born, what do you wish for yourself? To roam my lands, in search of new pray? I will not condemn a succubus for her endless lust. To stay as a servant always nearby? That can certainly be arranged. Or something else, born from your twisted desires?&#39;]

You take a moment to consider his question. It is so strange to have someone who understands you without judgement, who owns you and is willing to give you freedom, who has seen years beyond count and does not flinch at the deepest depths of your depravities.

$a[&#39;Then you can give me another one,&#39;] you reply instantly, cozying up to the ancient vampire. $a[&#39;Wouldn&#39;t you like that?&#39;]

He seems pensive for a minute. $R[&#39;There is such a thing as too many higher vampires under one roof... but I suppose I could use some of my magic to make you produce bruxae, or upiors. They can be useful servants in expanding our might.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Please do,&#39;] you say, dripping wet. $a[&#39;I shall give you an army, My Lord. Just keep me as your loyal incubator, swollen and obedient at your feet.&#39;]

The hand caresses your cheek with tenderness and lust. $R[&#39;If is what you desire, my dear demon. You can spend eternity bearing my seed, and nourishing my offspring.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Please, oh please please, My Lord. Truly, nothing will make me happier.&#39;]

$R[&#39;Then so it shall be, my little whore. You will swell over and over again, until you have forgotten your name and your mind is drowned in lust. I will make of you the embodiment of a Vessel, and keep you happy and round for all of your days.&#39;]

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/bad_end_elder2.jpg&quot;  width=&quot;800&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
$R[&#39;I see you are a curious one. I could teach you the depths of magic, should you ask nicely.&#39;]

$a[&#39;I want to learn all there is. Runes, rituals, ancient spells. I want to know what I am capable of, and what else exists out there.&#39;]

$R[&#39;So you wish to become a powerful spellcaster?&#39;] the Elder seems bemused.

$a[&#39;I wish to no longer be at the mercy of everyone that knows more than me. Well, everyone but you.&#39;]

As his fingers gently caress your throat, you feel his immense power radiate effortlessly around him. And perhaps one day your own power can be comparable. Eternity is a long time, and you have a mind eager to learn.

You rest your head at the Elder&#39;s lap, cupping your swollen belly with your hands. You are determined to become a succubus that shakes the earth with her step and sunders the skies with her wings. A creature of unbridled potential. You have so much to look forward to.

All the creatures, the grotesque delights, the pleasures from the darkest corners of your soul that you couldn&#39;t ever admit you wanted. Until now. $a[&#39;I wish to be depraved beyond words. To push the limits, and break them, then break them again. To lose myself in pleasures so twisted, mortal minds cannot dare to think them.&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/bad_end_elder2.jpg&quot;  width=&quot;800&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
Even without looking, you feel the Elder&#39;s grin. His fingers tenderly squueze your throat. 

$R[&#39;So you shall have it, my dear. Pleasures of the flesh are not my first priority, but I&#39;ve had my fill, I must admit. Eternity brings many reasons to explore.&#39;]

His thumb rises to your lips and you suck it gently. $a[&#39;Once, when you threw me into the pit, I was ravaged by a giant centipede, you know.&#39;]

$R[&#39;Ah, that old thing. Then I shall find you all the darkest of creatures and let them have their way with you, my dear, until you are moaning and screaming for mercy, and then I&#39;ll conjure another, even darker one.&#39;]

Your hand reaches between your legs, caressing your pussy, dripping from the thoughts. $a[&#39;An old friend once brought me to the edge, then forbade my release, just so I could revel in obedient humiliation...&#39;]

$R[&#39;Then I shall seal your demonic cunt for a year, tormenting your senses and fucking your ass, until frustration devours your mind like maddness and your body trembles at the slightest touch of your engorged nipples.&#39;] He caresses your cheeks lovingly. $R[&#39;And then, when the year is done, I will make you beg for another, or three, just because you can, just to see what it is.&#39;]

$R[&#39;It would amuse me to see you squeal, my dear wife.&#39;]

A warm feeling is spreading through your chest. $a[&#39;And what of others? I once helped Elise fill up a dear friend of mine, and though the guilt was overwhelming, I was exhalted...&#39;]

$R[&#39;I can bring you toys,&#39;] the Elder smirks. $R[&#39;No feelings of guilt should worry a succubus&#39; mind. Your loyalties are to me and the subjects of my domain. As for other mortal pawns-&#39;] he makes a dismissive gesture. $R[&#39;Do whatever you like with them. Fuck them, choke them. I am told Elise has a way of making them cum while she swells their bellies - I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy the show.&#39;]

You continue touching yourself, but then a shadow crosses your mind. $a[&#39;No, that isn&#39;t right. I don&#39;t want to be evil to humans.&#39;]

$R[&#39;Suit yourself, dear.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Punish me for this awful thought. Make me suffer.&#39;]

$R[&#39;I shall make you the cave troll&#39;s entertainment for the lunar solstice. Their cocks are bigger than mine.&#39;] The Elder laughs in a sinister, yet oddly affectionate manner.

$a[&#39;There are cave trolls?&#39;]

$R[&#39;You will love them.&#39;]

You lean your head on him again, gently caressing your belly. You have so much to look forward to.

You get up from your knees, joining the Elder by his side. He takes your hand and lifts it up into the air.

$R[&#39;This succubus, Alexandra, has pledged her loyalty to the house Petrescu and is now one of my subjects. Furthermore she has pledged herself to me, personally, joining me in unholy union to be the bearer of my next heir.&#39;]

His voice rings out with raw power, echoing across the meadow. The leaves rustle as if by an invisible wind.

After a moment of stupor, there is thunderous applouse and cheers from all sides. You feel all eyes on you and you blush. but hold firm. Somewhere behind you, Mihai is slowly clapping, though he doesn&#39;t say anything.

$R[&#39;Let it be know that henceforth she is an extension of my will, and any word from her is a word from me. Let none test my patience lest he learn the extent of my temper. And now, go! Return to your homes, drink, and celebrate! For today is the beginning of a new chapter, and as the Elder Blood persists, so shall your fortunes!&#39;]

There is more clapping and cheers, and howls, and other noises still coming farther from the forest, from shadows and hills, where no silhouettes lie. 

$R[&#39;Go!&#39;]

This time, the order is absolute. The gathered turn away, disappearing into the forest one by one, until finally it is only you, and Mihai, and Ionut, and of course the Elder, Vasil Petrescu. He turns around to face his family, gesturing you to follow.

$Mi[&#39;Father&#39;.]

There is a long, tense pause.

$R[&#39;I have put you through some harsh times. It is nothing but a testament to my faith in you. During my long slumber, the dominion has been in your hands, so you may learn the order of things, make mistakes, and come back stronger of it.

$Mi[&#39;I understand, father.&#39;]

$R[&#39;You must wonder what this all means to you. You are my first, and shall always remain so. But we are few, and humans have grown many. Times are shifting, and we must shift with them.&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;I almost expected you to start building a fort, father.&#39;] he chuckles, and the tension breaks.

Vasil laughs, a long, wicked, powerful laughter, filled with the dried blood of many vanquished foes. $R[&#39;I am old, Mihai, and I respect tradition, but that does not mean I am a fool! Blood must be renewed and our subjects must see that our power endures, our roots are strong!&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;You are right, father. I should have woken you earlier. But I thought... I thought things were going well.&#39;]

$R[&#39;All is right, my son,&#39;] Vasil places a hand on Mihai&#39;s shoulder. $R[&#39;With time, you will learn to be wary, to trust no one, to stay one step ahead of all friends and foes! But for now - you have done well. I am proud of you. Your role as head of The Crooked Elm remains unchanged as I shall address other, deeper matters.&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;Thank you, father, I shan&#39;t disappoint you.&#39;]

Father and son shake hands as the moon slowly drifts across the sky. 

$R[&#39;Now, if you will excuse us - I wish to speak a few more words to my son, alone. We can meet at the manor.&#39;] - the Elder turns towards you and Ionut with a meanigful look.

As you continue rubbing Ionut&#39;s bulge, your mind is wandering to find something creative to fill your bracelet all the way up.

$A[I wonder if Ionut would have the stamina to go multiple times...?]

Then, the answer stares right back at you. The closet is filled with countless jars of Ionut&#39;s special worms, the one he fishes from the graveyard. You&#39;ve sensed their magic before, and had some close encounters with the slimy creatures, which were all too eager to try and mate with you. 

$A[It&#39;s not exactly a classic approach, but as a succubus, I should be able to do something with their magical energy and desires...]

You slowly unbuckle Ionut&#39;s pants and sink to your knees, taking his cock in your mouth. You bob back and forth until the servant is groaning and rock hard, just ready to explode.

You rise up, grabbing one of the jars, and remove the lid. The worms begin slithering faster, as if anticipating something. You bit your lip. This won&#39;t be the worst you&#39;ve done, not by a long shot, but still you feel the delightful disgust rising in your belly.

The worm slithers inside, causing a cold, repulsive delight to propagete through your body.

$a[&#39;Aaahhh~&#39;] you moan, shivering from pleasure and disgust. The creature sinks deeper in, disappearing completely.

Without saying a word, Ionut brings the next one, and then the next, one by one helping the dark creatures to make their way in. You begin to feel a pleasant fullness, and a wriggling mass pushing its way further and further in. When the jar is depleted, you feel the tip of Ionut&#39;s member press against your entrance, hard as a rock.

$a[&#39;Do it, big guy. I know you want to.&#39;]

That&#39;s all he needs to slide inside you, increasing the sensation of fullness as his cock mixes with the slithering worms. His thrusts make slimy, sloppy sounds as he fucks you faster and faster, jamming the dark mass deeper towards your womb.

Ionut cums with a groan, and the bracelet grows hot on your wrist. You concentrate on the warmth of the bracelet, the heat in your belly, the $a[hunger] in your soul, and all that you&#39;ve learned about magic and the occult. The mass of worms begins wriggling more and more intensely, then suddenly....

It&#39;s gone. You feel an emptyness, almost a vacuum, and enrgy surges through your body, pouring into the bracelet. The beads glow and turn red, until it is completely full again.

$A[What a peculiar thing...] You certainly weren&#39;t expecting the necklace to stick around with you, and yet here it is. Perhaps it is a very special item, just like your bracelet. Or perhaps your own powers have grown somehow? You can&#39;t know. And yet - here it is.

You grasp the amulet with cold determination. $A[I&#39;ll makke her pay...]

A controlled rage fills your mind. Your horns feel harder and sharper, and you know for a fact that you will not be afraid to show her what you really are.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2316" name="saves debug" tags="menu" position="1050,1250" size="100,100">$T[DEBUG]

$R[(text-size:2)[Something went wrong. I&#39;m sorry ;(]]

You are viewing this page because the engine has encountered an error while attempting to save your progress. I sincerely apologise for the interruption and will try to hopefully resolve it.

You may go back to where you were, but your game will probably not be able to save (you may continue playing.) Alternatively, you may try to repair the save file.

If you want to just go back, click the button below. If you want to try to repair the save file, follow the steps afterwards.

[&lt;img src=&#39;https://xfiction.org/images/tr/interface/back3.png&#39; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;]&lt;b| (click: ?b)[(go-to: $lastPass)]

(text-size:2)[Repair steps]
&lt;hr&gt;
1. Click on the export button here to download a copy of your QuickSave Slot data: &lt;button class=&quot;harlowesave exportsave&quot; data-slotname=&quot;Slot A&quot; disabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Debug:  Export Quicksave&lt;/button&gt;

2. If you have successfully saved your file, please use the following function to delete the save from the game: &lt;button  class=&quot;harlowesave deleteslot&quot; data-slotname=&quot;Slot A&quot; disabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; Delete Quicksave&lt;/button&gt;

3. Please use the import function on your saved file. The script will attempt to catch potential errors and repair them: &lt;button class=&quot;harlowesave importsave&quot; data-slotname=&quot;Slot A&quot; disabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; Import &amp; Repair &lt;/button&gt;

4. Before you go - if you wish to help and report the issue, you can do so at the following channels:

TFG: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfgames.site/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=12739&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Transylvania Discussion Thread&lt;/a&gt;

F95: &lt;a href=&quot;https://f95zone.to/threads/transylvania-v0-4-03-xfiction.35032/&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Transylvania Discussion Thread&lt;/a&gt;

Discord: &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/FtP4w9K&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/interface/DiscordLogo.png&quot; height=&quot;50&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

5. You may load your recovered save from here: {(link-repeat: &quot;Quick Load&quot;)[
			(if: (saved-games:) contains &quot;Slot A&quot;)[(load-game:&quot;Slot A&quot;)]
			(else:)[ (replace:?hints)[  (display:&quot;quickload error&quot;) ] ] 
		]}

Hopefully, if the recovery was successful you should be able to save after that and you won&#39;t see this screen again.
