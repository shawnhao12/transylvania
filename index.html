The trip takes longer than you expected. At least it feels much longer.

You’re 22 years old, fresh out of a Bachelor’s degree in Corporate Communication, whatever that’s supposed to mean, and you’re almost broke. An airplane ticket is out of the question. 

So you take the bus to London, where you catch the Eurostar to Paris; it’s crowded and not particularly comfortable; you have to wait a couple of hours in Paris before catching the international train from Gare de Lyon, where you settle in a comfortable position in your third-class seat. 


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Prepare for the long ride.]](set: $time to &quot;21:45&quot;)(set: $hour to 21)(set: $minute to 45) (set: $money to 80)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Prepare for the long ride." tags="" position="2658,9869" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-Somewhere in Europe-]&lt;/div&gt;

$A[Why did I decide to do this anyways?]

It certainly wasn’t the money, though your bank account could appreciate every little bit it can get. 

“You’ll see the world and become wiser!” your mum said.

“You’ll nail some hot Romanian chicks!” argued your friends.

&quot;I&#39;ll finally have time to work on my book!&quot; you said to yourself.
You bought into those arguments and now here you are, ready for an adventure.

The train takes several days as it chugs its way through the green fields of eastern France, the small villages in the mountains of Germany and the hills of Austria, filled with more wind turbines and farms than you thought possible. 

You stop every now and then, get off at some station where you have a coffee and a sandwich while you chat to some random people, waiting for your next train relay. As you go farther East the locals speak less and less English and the polite Germanic accents are replaced with friendly but confused Slavic tones. You smile and nod, trying to remember some of the words. 

$A[After all, this is what it’s all about, right?]

$prot[($nTask: &quot;New task: Arrive at The Crooked Elm&quot;)]
(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Continue journey-&gt;get off.]](set: $day to &quot;Friday&quot;)(set: $time to &quot;9:20&quot;)(set: $hour to 9)(set: $minute to 20)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="get off." tags="" position="2774,9876" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-Somewhere in Europe-]&lt;/div&gt;

The final train drops you off at Timisoara, a big city in western Romania. From there you take another bus to Lugoj, but after that things get harder. You have to get to a village that’s so small it’s not even on the map. You spend the night at a cheap hotel then convince one of the locals to give you a ride in exchange for what little you have left in your wallet. 

$I[You lost 80£]

He drives silently as you follow the river Timish deeper into the mountains. The road is steep and perilous and in progressively worse condition the further away you go. You begin to wonder if you haven&#39;t fallen victim to some scam, the big country man next to you driving towards a secluded location... 

Before you have too much time to dwell on these thoughts, you spot a handful of rooftops nested among the trees.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Arrive at the village]](set: $day to &quot;Saturday&quot;)(set: $hour to 15)(set: $minute to 50) (set: $money to 0)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Arrive at the village" tags="" position="2895,9880" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-Somewhere in Romania-]&lt;/div&gt;

In any case, you arrive at //a village//.
$a[&#39;Am I at the right place?&#39;] you ask the man, but he shrugs, takes a few paces around the car to stretch his legs, then gets back in and drives off.

You look around - there is a road sign with a name, but it&#39;s broken, half of it missing and the edge charred as if struck by lightning. Even on the remaining part the paint is so old that you can’t really make out any of the letters. Still, this has to be it - there are no other villages nearby.

The village itself is very small - barely a few dozen stone houses at best. The mountain air is clean and fresh, filling your nostrils with the scent of old pines and green moss. Save for a few electric lamps barely illuminating the street, it doesn’t look very modern. Judging by the architectural style, it hasn&#39;t moved in the last few centuries. 

$A[Old and authentic, no technological distractions... this could be good for writing and inspiration. I&#39;m sure there are lots of legends and folklore to get out of the locals, if I ask them nicely...]

You notice a congregation of buildings that’s bound to be the main square.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Head to the village center]] (set: $time to &quot;17:30&quot;)(set: $hour to 17)(set: $minute to 30)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Head to the village center" tags="" position="2663,9989" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$vil&lt;/div&gt;

There isn&#39;t much here and you feel somewhat lost.

$a[‘Excuse me, I’m looking for… “The Crooked Elm” hotel. It’s in this village…’] In your best Romanian you address a passerby, a man in his forties wearing a respectable however old-fashioned suit. 

Along with your explanation you vaguely gesture around, hoping that you don’t sound too ridiculous. Given how few houses there are it’s somewhat embarrassing that you haven’t found the place yourself.

‘The residence is located outside of town’ he replies, surprising you with his flawless English and deep, suave voice. ‘Head down the main road this way - there is a small torrent that later joins into the river. Follow the path upstream, towards the mountains, and you shall find it in about an hour.’

$a[‘An hour!’] you exclaim. Just when you thought your journey was over.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Peer towards the mountainside]] (set: $time to &quot;18:00&quot;)(set: $hour to 18)(set: $minute to 0) (set: $timeStarted to true)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Peer towards the mountainside" tags="" position="2781,9993" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/div&gt;

You can make out the road the gentleman is talking about and even if you haven’t brought much luggage with you the thought of carrying your bags uphill for an hour disheartens you.

$a[‘Isn’t there some sort of transportation?’]  

You turn around, but the man is gone. In fact there isn’t anyone else around - if you didn’t know any better, you would have said that the village was deserted. 
 
The trees rustle in the wind. It’s only 6 p.m. but the village is on an eastern slope and with the sun blocked behind the tall ridges, the world is already sinking in velvet shadows. 

You sigh.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Head towards the hotel on foot]](set: $hour to 19)(set: $time to &quot;19:00&quot;)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Head towards the hotel on foot" tags="" position="2908,9993" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/div&gt;

After what seems like an eternity of back pain and sweating along the old stony path, the trees thin out on the left and you see a tall ornate gate surrounded by a fence of metal bars.

$I[ [    

]&lt;obs| ]

(display:&quot;eye&quot;)(link-repeat:&quot;Examine the gate&quot;)[(replace:?obs)[It appears to be hand forged and pretty solid, despite its state. There is a lock in the middle and two stone pillars on each side, decorated with stone gargoyles. You try to push it but it won&#39;t open, the metal only rattling ominously. You get the feeling that the statues are staring at you disapprovingly.]]

(display:&quot;eye&quot;)(link-repeat:&quot;Examine the fence&quot;)[(replace:?obs)[It&#39;s old and rusty, but still pretty solid. The spaces between the bars are too thin for you to squeeze through. You briefly consider jumping over it, but the bars have spikes on top and you wouldn&#39;t risk getting injured on an old rusty edge so far away from a hospital.] ]

(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Look through the gate]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Look through the gate" tags="" position="3016,9990" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/div&gt;

Behind you can make out a large grey manor built into the hillside.
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/environments/mansion.png&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
It’s several stories high, a central part and two wings with several towers and balconies looming over the mournful garden. It’s hard to make out everything in the darkness, but you estimate it has at least two dozen guest rooms, perhaps more. 

$A[Wow... the place must have been a real luxury resort back in the day, perhaps then the village was a popular tourist destination? A shame, now it reeks of disuse and decay... Could be a cool place to stay, but I doubt they get many visitors.

On the bright side, my job as a receptionist is probably going to be a whole lot of sitting around, waiting and doing nothing. Perhaps I could go back down to the village and find a pub, befriend the locals? Or maybe get back to that book I&#39;ve always wanted to write?]

A thought for later. For now, you should just move in.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Look for a way to open the gate]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Look for a way to open the gate" tags="" position="3151,9987" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/div&gt;

There doesn&#39;t seem to be any button attached to the gate, only a small brass doorbell with a string attached to it. It appears highly unlikely that anyone would be able to hear it all the way from here to the mansion.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Shout]]

(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Ring the doorbell]]

(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Try to call the hotel through your phone]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Shout" tags="" position="3403,10000" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/div&gt;

$a[&#39;Hellooooo? Anybody? I&#39;m locked out here!!&#39;]

You yell a couple more times, but nothing happens. You pace in front of the gate as the minutes pass. A few of the windows are lit up, which calms you somewhat, but clearly they can&#39;t hear you from here.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Try to call the hotel through your phone]] 

(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Ring the doorbell]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Ring the doorbell" tags="" position="3246,9868" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$gar&lt;/div&gt;

You pull the string and the bell rings with a faint and hollow sound. Instinctively, you step back without knowing why. After a few seconds, the gate creaks open.

$A[What is this, a hidden mechanism, or some sort of an elaborate joke? Would they go to such lengths just to create the illusion of a haunted house? Maybe it&#39;s good for their business, but still... I&#39;ll have to come back and figure it out later.]

Your back aches too much right now and even if there were a few hidden wires somewhere, you probably wouldn&#39;t be able to see them in the darkness anyways. 


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Take the path to the manor]](set: $time to &quot;19:30&quot;)(set: $minute to 30)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Try to call the hotel through your phone" tags="" position="3262,9994" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/div&gt;

You take out your phone and attempt to call the manager - you were given a number following your online job application - but your phone is out of range.

$A[Damn it!]

You were quite certain there was service back in the village, but you really don&#39;t feel like doing another 1 hour walk down. And then up again. //Ugh.//


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Shout]]

As you approach the main entrance, the front door creaks open and a silhouette of a man emerges from inside, carrying a metal candlestick.

$A[Yeah, definitely using the old building and the props as a means of attracting more visitors...]

Soon you&#39;re close enough to make out his features - he&#39;s middle aged, probably in his late fifties, with pale skin and bald head bearing a number of scars.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/ionut_3.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;

You stumble inside a reception room with a dusty wooden desk and several hallways splitting in different directions. On the right side there is a large staircase leading somewhere up in the darkness. The whole place is scarcely illuminated by a handful of candles, most attached to the walls. 

$Io[&#39;Your room vill be ready in a moment.&#39;] The man drops your luggage on the floor and takes the staircase, which creaks under each of his heavy steps. You follow the glow of his candle as he moves up until he takes a turn and disappears somewhere on the upper floor.

The desk is relatively large and made from a heavy, thick wood. It&#39;s furniture from another generation, when chairs and desks were built to last. You don&#39;t think you could ever move it even if you tried. 

There&#39;s also a little stand on it with a sign that currently reads &quot;CLOSED&quot;. Behind it is a stack of other signs - you flip through them: &quot;OPEN&quot;, &quot;BACK IN 10 MINUTES&quot;, &quot;BEWARE OF DOG&quot;. The last one looks like it hasn&#39;t been used for a while.

$A[So this is going to be my new workplace...]

[(display:&quot;eye&quot;)(link: &quot;Circle to the other side&quot;)[ (replace:?desk)[You move from the place of a visitor to the receptionist&#39;s seat. A part of you feels like you&#39;re trespassing, but you calm it down - after all this is your desk now.

You make a few steps into the hallways and the darkness quickly envelops you. Despite the candles the visibility is terrible and you get the feeling that the receptionist&#39;s desk is left somewhere far behind. With a slight unease you hurry to return to the relative illumination of the entrance.

The minutes tick as you absent-mindedly fiddle with your phone, playing sudoku. There&#39;s still no service.

$Mi[&#39;Good evening,&#39;] comes a voice from behind. Startled, you turn around.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
A young gentleman with a black suit and a golden cane is staring at you under his eyebrows. 

$Mi[&#39;I&#39;m Mihai Petrescu, the owner of the Crooked Elm. Or rather, the owner is my father, Vasil Petrescu, who is now too old to manage the business.&#39;]

The man looks at you with a blank stare.

$a[&#39;I&#39;m-&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;I know who you are. I have your file, right here.&#39;]

Mihai produces a paper from one of his pockets. 

$Mi[&#39;Twenty-two years old. Single. Somewhat educated.&#39;]

$a[&#39;I went to university for three years...&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;There&#39;s no shame. We have a library - you&#39;re free to use it, should you have the time. Speaking of which-&#39;]

Mihai takes out a metal key ring with four heavy keys.

$Mi[&#39;Here are your personal keys. One is for the gate outside, one for the front door, the library and for your room.&#39;]

You take the keys and hold them awkwardly in your hand. The key ring is way too large for your jeans&#39; pockets.

$a[&#39;But all the candles...&#39;]

$I[Character entry updated in journal]] (replace:?q2)[] ]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="I have no more questions" tags="desk" position="3399,9275" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-ENTRANCE-]&lt;/div&gt;

$Mi[&#39;Very well, then. I&#39;ll show you to your room.&#39;]

Mihai heads to the staircase and starts climbing, waving you a hand to follow him. In the candlelight the many jeweled rings on his hand glitter mysteriously.

You grab your bags and one of the candles.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Climb up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Climb up" tags="floor1" position="3392,9139" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-FLOOR 1-]&lt;/div&gt;

The upper floor is covered by a soft red carpet that absorbs almost all noise. You can see a variety of weapons and trophies hung on the walls, as well as an ominous figure sanding at the far end. You squint your eyes and then relax - it&#39;s just an old piece of armor.

You try to tentatively stomp the floor, but it&#39;s almost inaudible. For a while you&#39;re lost in the silence, not hearing the familiar tapping of Mihai&#39;s cane. Silence and darkness... 

Your eyes fall on a golden door right in front of you. One of many, in fact, as you realise looking both ways.

$A[I wonder what&#39;s the room like...]

$Mi[&#39;Over here, Mister Reid&#39;]

You see the light of the candle to the right, moving upwards still to the next floor.


(display:&quot;eye&quot;)[[Maybe take a quick glance inside the room...]]

The next floor is almost identical, save for the carpet being purple and the doors a dark green. You can make out a handful of portraits along the walls, but before you have time to look properly at any of them, Mihai continues upwards.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Follow-&gt;Mihai continues upwards.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Maybe take a quick glance inside the room..." tags="floor1" position="3228,9066" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-FLOOR 1-]&lt;/div&gt;

You grab the doorhandle and twist it to the side, when you get the eerie sensation that you&#39;re being watched. With the corner of your eye you catch a flickering in the distant end of the hallway.

You turn around, but there&#39;s nothing there. Even with squinting your eyes, you can&#39;t tell what was the thing that flickered.

$A[What the hell...? Do they have security cameras in this place?]

You look left and right again, trying to locate the source of your anxiety, but the dark hallways offer little consolation. In the end you leave the door alone.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Follow your host-&gt;Follow]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Mihai continues upwards." tags="" position="3395,8845" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$T[-ATTIC-]&lt;/div&gt;

The third floor is noticeably different, with sloped ceilings and a larger number of doors indicating smaller, cramped spaces.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$Mi[&#39;The garrets and storage rooms are on this floor.&#39;] says Mihai. $Mi[&#39;As well as the staircases that lead to the towers. But Ionut will give you a proper tour around tomorrow. You must be terribly tired. This is your room.&#39;]

He leads you to a door located not far on the left, seemingly indistinct from the others apart from the small metal plaque indicating number 5. Mihai produces a single key from the inside of his vest and with a subtle //click// the door opens.

$A[That must be the master key that opens every door around here... makes sense. No need for *him* to carry a large batch of keys around.]

$Mi[&#39;Sleep well. Tomorrow is Sunday and we aren&#39;t expecting any visitors, so you&#39;ll have the day to yourself. Use it to get familiar with the place. Go to the village if you like, but don&#39;t spend the whole day there. Your work starts on Monday morning. Ionut will explain your duties.&#39;]

You nod and smile politely.

Small and simple, your room has just the bare necessities - a bed, a wardrobe, a desk and a chair. A single window is looking out to what you expect is the back garden. There is also a nightstand with a drawer and a lamp, candlestick and an inkwell on top.

You wake up refreshed, your hard mattress and simple cover providing surprisingly good sleep. Looking through the window in the daylight, you can see a large garden spanning behind the manor - alleys lined with elm trees, stone benches and statues, even a little fountain.

You get dressed, picking a pair of jeans and t-shirt. The day is ahead of you, but perhaps first you should have some breakfast?

After some searching you find the dining hall on the ground floor, near the reception. It&#39;s a spacious room lined with tall windows creating the illusion of a glass wall looking towards the garden. The light that stems in is a dirty grey, and while a little melancholic, you don&#39;t find it unpleasant.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/ionut_3.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
You look at the antique chairs and tables, wondering if they&#39;re fully functional or just for decoration.

$Io[&#39;Sit! Today - I cook. Vat do you vant?&#39;]

The servant&#39;s face peers through an opening in the opposite wall, complete with a metal counter and stacks of plates.

$A[That must be the kitchen...]

$a[&#39;I&#39;ll have eggs and bacon.&#39;] you shout back.

$Io[&#39;Coming vright up!&#39;]

Soon you hear a pleasant sizzling and then Ionut comes out, dropping a hot plate of bacon and eggs on your table. You notice that he walks a little funny, but your mind is busy elsewhere. $A[Perhaps his leg hurts?] It doesn&#39;t matter. You start munching and tell yourself that he doesn&#39;t look like a bad guy after all. Yesterday he looked a little creepy, insidious even, but right now you&#39;re willing to believe he&#39;s just the average Joe who happens to have a strong accent and misshapen, bald head. It&#39;s hardly his fault.

$Io[&#39;It is gud, ja?&#39;]

$a[&#39;Ja, ja, sehr gut!&#39;] you reply instinctively. The trip through Europe really scrambled your head with languages. Before you can correct your mistake however, he returns to the kitchen.

You push your empty plate aside and pat your belly. That was a good breakfast. As if sensing that you&#39;re done, the servant emerges again and comes to sit in front of you, placing two cups of coffee on the table.

$Io[&#39;Nice to meet. I Ionut.&#39;] he grins at you.

$a[&#39;Hello, Ionut, I&#39;m Alex,&#39;] you reply.

There is an awkward pause.

$Io[&#39;So, start tomorrow.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Yes. What do I have to do?&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Several things. Virst: stay at reception.&#39;]

$a[&#39;The whole day?&#39;]

$Io[&#39;From 6 to 10.&#39;]

$a[&#39;6 to 10?!&#39; that&#39;s 18 hours!&#39;]

$Io[&#39;No, only 4 hours&#39;], he corrects you - $Io[&#39;6 in the avternoon.&#39;]

You look at Ionut, confused.

$Io[&#39;Nobody come early. Guest come - they sleep; they go.&#39;]

$A[That explains why the pay is so low...but I&#39;ll have lots of free time, so that&#39;s not too bad.]

$Io[&#39;Help move their luggage to room. Give key, of course. Keys behind desk.&#39;]

Ionut takes a sip from his coffee, as if thinking if he&#39;s forgetting anything. His skin, pale and thick, makes his face look like an unfinished clay sculpture. 

$a[&#39;So... that&#39;s it?&#39;] You still can&#39;t believe that your work day is only 4 hours.

$Io[&#39;That&#39;s it. During day you free. If need help - I ask, you come. If Mister Petrescu need something - he tell you. Rest of time - up to you. Try not get lost in the forest.&#39;]

You drink your own coffee, letting the information sink in. It seems that you&#39;ll have some time on your hands.


(display:&quot;talk&quot;)[[So, can you give me a tour?]]

(display:&quot;talk&quot;)[[Thanks Ionut, that&#39;s all for now.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="So, can you give me a tour?" tags="desk" position="3636,8585" size="100,100">(if:$intro&gt;1)[(goto:&quot;short_tour&quot;)]&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$rec&lt;/div&gt;

$Io[&#39;Yes. Come.&#39;]

You stand up and follow the servant.

$Io[&#39;Ve are in the dining hall. If you vant breakvast - before 11. If you vant dinner - betveen 20 and 22. Else - stay hungry.&#39;]

Looking at Ionut, it&#39;s hard to tell if he&#39;s being serious or is attempting some kind of joke. In either case, he continues the tour.

$Io[&#39;Ground floor - center - reception; left side - kitchen; right side - saloon, rooms for games.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Games?&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Mostly cards and pool. Go if you vant. Avter that - library. Need key.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Yes, Mr. Petrescu gave me one yesterday.&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Good.&#39;]

Ionut waves towards the stairway.

Ionut gives you a nod and finishes his coffee. While he drinks, you notice that the thumb on this right hand is abnormally large and a slightly different shade. $A[Perhaps a birth defect?]

He returns to the kitchen with his slightly waddling walk, leaving you alone with your thoughts. The day is still young and you have some options of what to do.

The manor is surrounded by an expansive garden circled by the fence which you first saw last night. You walk along it for a while, but it keeps going as far as you can see, the terrain becoming rougher and even less well-kept the farther away from the mansion you go. 

Eventually the low, sickly grass is replaced by ever taller thorns and bushes, making your advance difficult. When you&#39;re about to give up, you notice another $in[gate] in the fence.

You know that the village isn&#39;t much, but it&#39;s still your closest link to civilization, so you force yourself to do the hour walk downhill, trying not to think that you&#39;ll have to climb back again.

You arrive at the village winded, but the fresh mountain air helps you quickly cool down. The tall mountain trees cast the village into a deep shade and despite the burning summer sun in its zenith, the place feels veiled from its heat.
(if: $duh is 0)[(set: $hour to ($hour+1))]
$A[Like it was in another world...]

You explore the village roads, the fleeting faces of its inhabitants glancing at you through the windows as you go. You never meet anyone&#39;s gaze directly, but you can feel their eyes on the back of your head, following you around. 
(set: $duh to 1)
You expected the village to be only a few simple households, but during your walk you discover there is an $in[antique shop], a small $in[inn] and a $in[hunting cabin]. 


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Have a look at the antique shop-&gt;antique shop]]

Hidden in between two massive stone houses, the antique shop is a sort of extension linking its neighbours, making you think of some sort of small critter that saw an empty space and decided to dwell there. Its narrow facade - with barely enough space for a small door and a single window - and irregular architecture were the reason you miss it the first few times, but you eventually notice the faded inscription infront &quot;ANT  QUE   BOUTI UE&quot;.

You push the door of the boutique, bending a little to avoid hitting your head on the low doorframe. The inside of the shop is dusty and cramped with hundreds of small objects - you see furniture and decorations; jewelry, small figurines and toys; watches, mostly mechanical as far as you can tell; pens and quills; posters, stamps and postcards, a lot of ornate boxes and an immense sea of undefined and unknowable shapes. 

The shop is illuminated by small electric bulbs that cover everything with a dirty, yellow light, as if it was a second-hand light used and reused throughout the centuries and too tired to shine like it used to. The boutique, though cramped and narrow, extends inward, like the belly of a giant whale which has swallowed thousands of objects over its life and now lies comatose, slowly digesting.

With the corner of your eye you sense something moving.

A small wooden building in the outskirts of the village, the hunting cabin has a distinct look thanks to the various antlers and animal heads hanging from its walls.

Seemingly out of nowhere, a young woman has appeared behind the counter, looking at you with a mischievous smile. At first glance she appears no older than yourself, probably in her early twenties. Her hair is dark and curly, with a tinge of violet, her skin - flawless and pale like marble, and her green eyes - is that a hint of yellow? - peer straight through you with a wild, feline stare.

Without waiting for your reply, she transitions instantaneously from one side of the counter to the other, standing next to you, her fingers already picking different watches from the dusty shelves, giving them a soft brush before sliding them around your wrist, giving a short $M[&quot;tss, tss, not the right one&quot;] and putting them back on the row again. 

$a[&#39;I-, oh-, wait-&#39;]

The more you think about it the fuzzier your memories become, to the point where you start questioning if it wasn&#39;t all just a dream. But then you look down on your wrist, the little bracelet dangling inconspicuously with its strange beads as if it was pretending to be a normal object.

$B1[**Dating back to the Slavic tribes before the middle ages, the inhabitants of what is known today as the Romanian mountains have always followed a strict code of social and geopolitical hierarchy, separating the region into autonomous constituencies known as &quot;hills&quot;. Every hill had its own ruler, a hereditary title, who held power over the land and its people and in exchange vowed protection for his subjects. 

Some believe that the modern expression &quot;king of the hill&quot; originated from these early societal structures. Throughout the history of the region, different countries and kings have claimed the territories to be within their borders, but they have mostly respected the hills and their power.**]

A red volume with thin white paper, &quot;Legends from the Mountains&quot; is a collection of myths and old tales accompanied with exquisite drawings in colour. You open a chapter at random:

$B2[//Transylvanian folklore has become known worldwide for its legends about **vampires**. One of the common misconceptions however, associated with this mythos, is the portrayal of the vampire as a solitary creature that inhabits some distant and forsaken place such as a castle or a ruin. 

In truth, vampires are depicted in the old tales as social creatures that live in packs and abide by a strict hierarchy. Every pack is led by an Elder,  a powerful being that has acquired knowledge and skills over centuries. He is followed by his son^^1^^ and then by a handful of lesser vampires who usually do not live in the same place but in surrounding villages or dwellings, which together form the **Elder Covenant**.

^^1^^//]$B2sub[ The Elder always has a single son to avoid infights for the heritage. While vampires are portrayed with a lifespan of centuries, they&#39;re not believed to be immortal, and thus the son eventually replaces his father and becomes the new Elder. Elders do not take other vampires for wives for the same reason - a potential claim for power - and thus resort to humans for the purpose of breeding.]

Yawning from the long and exhausting day, you put the few pages of your manuscript in the drawer and blow out the candle. 

The room plunges in silver darkness, the silhouettes outlined by the shine of the almost full moon outside. You lie on the hard mattress, thinking about the mysterious events of the day.

Suddenly, you&#39;re feeling a little curious to explore the top floor.

You descend to the second floor, the velvet carpet muffling your footsteps. Even in the cold light of the morning the manor looks shadowy and unwelcoming, the dust hanging in the air like thick goo.

To your surprise, one of the doors on your right opens and a woman walks out in the hallway, walking towards you without a sound. 

She is tall and dark - her ebony skin and short black hair reflecting the light with an almost metallic sheen. However what is most peculiar about her are her proportions - her head is small and thin, her stick-like arms flail around her equally thin torso which is covered with a tight leather jacket. And still, despite this slim and skinny upper section, under her waist her body bulges out into an entirely different shape: her ass - round and protruding - is almost a separate entity altogether, occupying - you genuinely wonder - almost as much space as the rest of her.
(set: _ti to 8)
As she closes the distance towards you, her round green spectacles - glare straight at you, like a pair of alien eyes. Her gaze makes your heart pound faster, filling you with indescribable, inexplicable emotions. 

The woman raises a hand gloved in the same black leather and points a bony finger at you:

$E[&#39;You must be the new maid. My room requires assistance.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Uhm, I&#39;m not a handmaid...&#39;]

You take a table at the opposite side of the room, leaving Mihai at a safe distance. Ionut&#39;s head appears at the kitchen window, giving you a clumsy wink:

&#39;Eggs and bakon, ja?&#39;

A few minutes later, while you&#39;re eating in the semi-complete darkness of the dining hall, a new silhouette enters the room. You immediately identify the bizarre outline of the woman you met earlier. She takes a seat across the table from Mihai, occupying what appears to be the biggest armchair you&#39;ve ever seen, with a seat large enough for two people to sit on side by side comfortably and a tall back covered in numerous fancy cushions. Her slim body and small round head look almost ridiculous in comparison, yet somehow she seems to fill the chair quite nicely with the rest of her body...

Looking at her you start getting a headache and you move your gaze away, rubbing your tired eyes. The room is so dark and the candles so faint that the shadows are starting to play tricks on you.. Bits of the conversation make their way to you, but it&#39;s too low and jumbled to make any sense.

You walk along it for a while, but it keeps going as far as you can see, the terrain becoming rougher and even less well-kept the farther away from the mansion you go. 

Eventually the low, sickly grass is replaced by ever taller thorns and bushes, making your advance difficult. When you&#39;re about to give up, you notice another $in[gate] in the fence.

Tall and rusty, it&#39;s similar to the first one, though definitely not the same. The path leading to it is barely distinguishable, overtaken with $in[brambles and bad weeds].

The inside of the basement is more akin to the opening of a dungeon, with a cold stony floor and pillars supporting the manor on top. There are matches left near the hatch and you use them to light a torch which illuminates well enough the space several feet around you.

There are pipes and valves covering most of the east wall and going into the ceiling, as well as a handful of crates, a workbench and some tools hanging near it, more torches and cobwebs wobbling by the cold draft; and of course, there is the [[generator]].

Besides, when you get back down you&#39;ll lock the gate behind you and sneak the key on Ionut&#39;s keyring. Nobody will ever know a thing...

You start climbing, using the screen of your phone as a source of light to guide your way. Even if there isn&#39;t any reception up here, at least it&#39;s good for something. 

The staircase continues for quite some time, spiraling upwards for what seems like hundreds of steps. From time to time there are doors on the side, but you&#39;re really interested in getting to the top.

After what seems like an eternity, you reach the last step and a small platform leading to a single wooden door. Fortunately enough, there isn&#39;t any lock here, only a brass handle that looks like it hasn&#39;t been used in a while.

You draw a deep breath and [[enter the room]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="95" name="enter the room" tags="" position="5597,1648" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt; 

The faint light of your screen illuminates a small halo around you in what seems like complete and total darkness. There aren&#39;t any silhouettes of objects around you - no furniture, no old stuff, nothing at all. You turn to all directions but as far as you can tell the room is empty. And completely dark. 

It&#39;s a darkness that envelops you and sticks to your clothes, a rich and dense darkness which makes it hard to breathe and almost drowns you. Walking in a straight line you reach the wall - and indeed the windows - and examine them with increasing astonishment. They have been covered with some black and impenetrable material that makes it impossible to tell that it&#39;s actually day outside.

Raising your phone higher, you see the something big and round hanging from the ceiling above. It shifts uneasily, as if irritated by the light you&#39;re pointing towards it, it&#39;s enormous leathery wings curling to protect it&#39;s head...

&#39;**Vat have you done!!!**&#39;

You turn around to the enormous figure of Ionut charging towards you at full speed.

$A[**&#39;Wait, I was ju-&#39;**]

The ground beneath you is cold and rough, the rocks painfully digging into your spine. Your entire body feels numb and heavy, as if an enormous weight is pushing you down. 

With great effort you force your eyes open and stare at the grey sky above. And the walls of earth around you.

$A[**&#39;Mhmhmhmhmhm!!!&#39;**] You try to scream, but your mouth is gagged. Ionut, towering somewhere above you, continues his work with the shovel, slowly and methodically burying your body five feet into the barren soil.

Panic sets in and you begin to struggle, trying to get out, but your(if:$dead&gt;0)[ weak, feminine] hands and feet are bound and the increasing weight of the earth on top of you is too much. Chunks of dirt fall on your chest, splattering a handful of worms on your naked body.

You approach the window, but it&#39;s too dirty to peer inside.

You approach the door of the inn, knocking on the little wooden trap-door. It opens and the same angry face appears in the frame.

&#39;You again. Go avay! We closed!&#39; the man shouts, slamming it in your face.

As soon as you push the door open, the little overhead bell announces your arrival. You look towards the counter and meet the green eyes of the enigmatic woman.

$M[&#39;Yes, it&#39;s mostly used by demons, particularly succubae. Since you were so different... the charm had to make adjustments to make you compatible.&#39;]

$M[&#39;Yes, darling?&#39;] She flashes you a toothy smile.

$a[&#39;I&#39;m afraid I need some clothes. Mihai said he wanted me to be representable... and I&#39;m also a girl now.&#39;] You gulp. $a[&#39;I don&#39;t have any girl clothes.&#39;]

$M[&#39;Not to worry!&#39;] The green-eyed catwoman springs up. $M[&#39;We&#39;ll get you sorted right away! You will be so pwetty! [[Follow me!]]&#39;]

You stumble outside, half-expecting the town to be a hellish dungeon or a monster-infested den, but to your disappointment it turns out to be neither of those. In fact you can&#39;t spot any differences from before. 

You briefly consider lingering around to look for something unusual, but your curiosity gets the best of you and you set towards the manor at a [[brisk pace]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="124" name="Follow her" tags="shop" position="3153,161" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$ant&lt;/div&gt;

The shop, long and narrow, truly stretches inwards like the entrails of a giant beast, twisting left and right with openings occasionally appearing to either side, the weak yellowish light from the bulbs in a constant losing battle to the shadows sprouting everywhere. 

As $Felicia leads you farther along rows of jars with strange thick substances inside and shelves filled with books of every shape and size, you wonder how the architecture of the boutique is even possible. From the outside it looked like a small construction nuzzled between two houses, but it just seems to continue winding somewhere else entirely.

Eventually you reach a section where numerous dresses and overcoats are left hanging, followed by other old garments of all varieties.

$M[&#39;Hold on for a minute, I&#39;ll fetch something for you&#39;] Your green-eyed host disappears somewhere between them all.

You sit on an old box.

After a bit, your friend pops out, carrying with her two sets of costumes that she hangs on a nearby rack.

$M[&#39;They&#39;re your size, my eye never lies. Pick the one that suits your style.&#39;]

You approach to examine the clothes. The first set appears to be some sort of $in[butler uniform]. $A[It would certainly fit a receptionist.] The second one is more neutral, like an old $in[gentleman&#39;s outfit].

It seems to be the most appropriate option. While you&#39;re not exactly a butler, you&#39;re part of the staff and at the service of the owner and the guests. This garment is the most befitting of your social ranking.

If Mr. Petrescu wants you to look like a real gentleman and not embarrass him in front of his (obviously important) guests, then this is surely the best option. Besides, the British practically invented the gentleman&#39;s style. Your blood demands it!

Well, why the hell not? If Mihai wants you to look fashionable and not embarrass him, why not go all the way?

Stepping out of the Antique Boutique, you&#39;re greeted with a $in[night sky and a full moon overhead.]

$A[**What the hell?!**]

You take out your phone and check the time - it&#39;s [$hour:$minute]&lt;time|. 

Your jaw drops and you feel a deep unease and vertigo. How could this be? It doesn&#39;t make any sense.

You remember distinctly entering the boutique not so long ago and it was still early! You didn&#39;t spend more than 30-40 minutes in there, maximum an hour, and yet somehow...

With a racing heart you run through the village and reach the stream. With no idea what&#39;s going on, getting back to the manor seems the best option.


(display:&quot;goto&quot;)[[Return to the hotel-&gt;best option]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="131" name="best option" tags="" position="3855,103" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt;

The road is dark and barely distinguishable, even under the full moon. If you hadn&#39;t already walked it a number of times you&#39;d be long lost. The forest, black and forbidding, is eerily quiet save for the wind blowing between the pines.

Then there is another sound - the distant howling of wolves, somewhere to the east. You&#39;re acutely aware just how dangerous this path can be at night. You should have never stayed this late at the village, but damn the time flew impossibly at the antique shop.

Suddenly you catch something with the corner of your eye, a blurry movement between the trees on the other side of the stream. Curiosity however is topped by the voice of caution  and your pace quickens, not waiting to see what is lurking about.

As you turn a corner on the road, a few hundred feet farther upstream, you see a silhouette of a man blocking the way.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/wolf.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

With a cautious step you approach the figure, it&#39;s outline becoming more unnatural and bizarre to your silent horror. When it&#39;s barely a few feet away you can see that the thing is half-human half-wolf, wearing the torn remnants of clothes through which fur and claws portrude.

It emits a low growl and you peer up straight into two flaming yellow eyes and a giant drooling jaw...

You turn around and start running without looking back. There was something sinister and unnatural in the silhouette that you saw and you&#39;re not going to stick around to see up close what it was.

A howl tears through the night, long and piercing and, worst of all, right behind you. You switch into a sprint, running as fast as you can, but soon you can hear steps behind you, approaching fast.

With the blood pumping in your ears and the world spinning wild, you leave the clearing of the path and plunge into the [[darkness of the trees]].

You manage to gain some distance and can no longer hear the steps behind you, but carry on running anyways, the thorns and bushes catching on your newly acquired outfit and tearing it up with a hundred small cuts. 

When you feel that you&#39;ve lost your pursuer, whoever it was, you finally stop to catch your breath, leaning your back behind a big mossy boulder. Your lungs feel on fire and every breath is a pain in your chest, but at least you got away. The bad part is that the forest is utterly dark and you have no idea where you are. 

Without much of a choice, you [[pick a direction at random]].

You stop by a giant fallen trunk, crouching next to rough bark, when suddenly you hear a low growl and look up straight into two flaming yellow eyes and a giant drooling jaw...

With the blood pumping in your ears and the world spinning wild, you leave the clearing of the path and plunge into the darkness of the trees&quot;,
&quot;The shop, long and narrow, truly stretches inwards like the entrails of a giant beast, twisting left and right with openings occasionally appearing to either side, the weak yellowish light from the bulbs in a constant losing battle to the shadows sprouting everywhere. 

As Felicia leads you farther along rows of jars with strange thick substances inside and shelves filled with books of every shape and size, you wonder how the architecture of the boutique is even possible. From the outside it looked like a small construction nuzzled between two houses, but it just seems to continue winding somewhere else entirely.

Eventually you reach a section where numerous dresses and overcoats are left hanging, followed by other old garments of all varieties.&quot;,
&quot;You take the familiar path downhill following the little stream. Perhaps the mountain air is already having a positive effect or perhaps you&#39;re getting used to the road, but this time the trip is less exhausting.

The forest around you is beautiful in an eerie way, the tall trees casting a deep shade that has stifled most of the low vegetation between them, creating a surprisingly clear space on the ground, filled mostly with lots of dry pinecones and the occasional bush.&quot;,
&quot;The doors of the hatch take some effort to lift but you eventually manage to open them, removing the vines that have already started to crawl on top.

The inside of the basement is more akin to the opening of a dungeon, with a cold stony floor and pillars supporting the manor on top. There are matches left near the hatch and you use them to light a torch which illuminates well enough the space several feet around you.

There are pipes and valves covering most of the east wall and going into the ceiling, as well as a handful of crates, a workbench and some tools hanging near it, more torches and cobwebs wobbling by the cold draft; and of course, there is the generator.

On the opposite side of the room there is another door leading further down...&quot;,
&quot;With a hungry stomach, you enter the dining hall and are greeted with a strange sight. All the windows have been covered with heavy wooden shutters from the exterior, such that barely any sunlight enters the room at all. To compensate for this, candles have been lit on almost all of the tables, their faint flames doing little but pushing the darkness a couple of feet away.

Sitting on a large ornate table not far from the entrance, you recognise the silhouette of a man with a golden cane.

&#39;Ah, Mr. Reid. Coming for some breakfast?&#39;

&#39;Yes, I was hungry... pardon my curiosity, Mr. Petrescu&#39; - you decide to lean on the side of caution when addressing your boss - &#39;but what is all this?&#39;

&#39;Just having breakfast with an old friend, no cause for worry. It&#39;s much more romantic this way, don&#39;t you find?&#39; Something in his tone implies that disagreement is not really an option.

&#39;Yes, of course, Mr. Petre-&#39;

&#39;Although it would be better with the grand chandelier&#39; - he points upwards towards a heavy ball of light bulbs and crystals - &#39;but unfortunately the power is still down. Speaking of which, have you any intention of going down to the village today?&#39;&quot;,
&quot;&#39;Eggs and bakon, ja?&#39;

You give him a nod and he disappears again, followed by the sound of sizzling.

A few minutes later, while you&#39;re eating in the semi-complete darkness of the dining hall, a new silhouette enters the room. You immediately identify the bizarre outline of the woman you met earlier. She takes a seat across the table from Mihai, occupying what appears to be the biggest armchair you&#39;ve ever seen, with a seat large enough for two people to sit on side by side comfortably and a tall back covered in numerous fancy cushions. Her slim body and small round head look almost ridiculous in comparison, yet somehow she seems to fill the chair quite nicely with the rest of her body...

Looking at her you start getting a headache and you move your gaze away, rubbing your tired eyes. The room is so dark and the candles so faint that the shadows are starting to play tricks on you.. Bits of the conversation make their way to you, but it&#39;s too low and jumbled to make any sense.&quot;,
&quot; To your surprise, one of the doors on your right opens and a woman walks out in the hallway, walking towards you without a sound. She is tall and dark - her skin and short hair black as ebony. However what is most peculiar about her are her proportions - as she advances you can see the outline of  her body: her head is small and thin, and her stick-like arms flail around her equally skeletal torso which, if it has breasts at all, hides them very well under a tight leather jacket. And still despite this slim and skinny upper section, under her waist her body bulges out into an entirely different shape: her ass - round and protruding - is almost a separate entity altogether, occupying - you genuinely wonder - almost as much space as the rest of her.        &quot;,
&quot;You leave your room and head instinctively towards the staircase, when a cold breeze brushes an icy finger on your cheek. You look both ways - all the windows are closed - but after all this is a pretty old house... 

Suddenly, you&#39;re feeling a little curious to explore the top floor. Both Mihai and Ionut were very brief about it, and you wonder if there aren&#39;t some hidden delights to find - perhaps an opening to the roof? Surely the view to the mountain will be breathtaking. And then there are the towers... you could always take a peek around.      &quot;,
&quot;You wake up full of energy and ready to take on the world! Despite the limited commodities, you had a good night&#39;s sleep and are looking forward to your first day of work. 

...which starts at  6pm. In your enthusiasm you&#39;d almost forgotten. Still, you&#39;ll probably find something useful to do during the day!    &quot;,

You rise in your bed and toss the covers aside. There is an immediate and profound sensation that something is off. Then apprehension strikes - your body is different. Smaller waist; leaner, hairless legs; you raise up your hands - they&#39;re similar, but definitely different - smaller, more delicate; your gaze falls down on a pair of mounds bulging your pyjamas.

You shoot out of bed and into the small bathroom attached to your chamber, where a strange new face is looking at you in the mirror. 

Well, some of it is not new - your eyes are the same, dark brown, unchanged; your hair is almost the same, dark straight, though perhaps longer. 

You concentrate on your features - they have shifted around in slight but important ways, crafting the face of a young, beautiful woman staring with an open jaw and wide, terrified eyes.

Stumped in shock, you fall a few steps back.

Thinking is hard and as you clutch your head with both hands your thoughts buzz inside like a swarm of angry wasps, too fast and dangerous to catch. Minutes pass until you manage to calm down your beating heart. Your gaze absent-mindedly falls on the bracelet on your hand and the (colour:&quot;#FFCCCC&quot;)[four crimson beads] that decorate it.

$A[Alright, Alex.. what&#39;s going on? Did I take any drugs? Did someone slip me something?] 

You let the confusion wash over you for a few minutes, then your rational mind kicks in. $A[This is real.] You pinch your thigh and the pain reaches your brain, sobering it up. 

$A[I&#39;m Alex, I was a student, I grew up with my parents in England...] 

A wave of new and confusing memories swirls around your head, but you chase them away. 

$A[...and then I travelled to Romania for a summer job. I&#39;m currently in a hotel in a village located high in the mountains above Timisoara.] 

You look down at the two small bumps on your chest currently covered by your pyjamas. 

$A[...and apparently somehow, for some reason, I have become a girl.] 

You try to think very hard about the last thing you remember, but your recollection from last night is vague at best. 

$A[Given the irrefutable weight of reality, I must allow the possibility that the supernatural exists and it has affected me in some way. In some very peculiar way indeed...]

Swallowing your pride you give her a small nod to which she returns a poisonous smile before letting you stroll down the hallway. Her room is almost at the end, and as you approach you notice that the door is slightly ajar.

With a hungry stomach, you enter the dining hall and are greeted with a strange sight. All the windows have been covered with heavy curtains. Barely any sunlight enters the room.

Candles have been lit on almost all of the tables, their faint flames doing little but pushing the darkness a couple of feet away.

Sitting on a large ornate table not far from the entrance, you recognise the silhouette of a man with a golden cane.

The first thing that strikes you is the silk. The sheets on the bed, the curtains on the windows, the tablecloth, even the carpet is made from a silvery silky-smooth material that gives the place an overall light-greyish tone. It feels like stepping in some eerie dream.

You run two floors up, stopping to catch your breath. 

$A[Well, that was embarrassing! I hope he didn&#39;t notice anything weird... But is he really a vampire? He looks odd and all, but it&#39;s all too much to swallow... perhaps that darned cat is taking me for a fool and mocking me behind my back!]

You look up and freeze in horror as a giant, truck-sized eight-legged black nightmare glides along the corridor straight towards you. You fall back on the floor, your legs wriggling and scrambling to push you towards the wall, as far away as possible from the thing. 
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/elise_spider.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
The spider reaches you in seconds, its long stick-like legs gripping on the walls and ceiling as it moves and its large, round abdomen dragging behind it. It cocks its head to one side, peering towards you with 8 black pearls. You try to stifle a whimper looking at its long hairy jaws just an arm&#39;s reach from your face.

$E[&#39;What&#39;s the matter, girl? Did you bite your tongue?&#39;]

$E[&#39;A shame really, and she was kinda pretty. Tsk, tsk.&#39;]

There is a sharp pain on the side of your neck and your vision begins to fade, the sensations in your limbs growing weaker and somehow distant.

You slowly wake up on a silky bed underneath silky drapes. No! Your view shifts again and grows sharper, the veil fading away. You&#39;re on a giant spiderweb, intricate and complex, woven like a bed and drapes, and like blankets and sheets, like carpet and curtains. All around, the room is littered with bones of various shapes and sizes, all gnawed to a clean white. Beside them lay the corpses of smaller animals, sucked dry and shriveled as if there remained nothing but a layer of skin covered by dry fur.

Your attention shifts back to yourself - laying on your back, body wrapped in a cocoon neck to toes, with only your head sticking out to breathe. You can&#39;t help but notice that your belly is bulging out abnormally, swollen to the size of a basketball. Your terror is multiplied as you feel a soft movement inside you and you start screaming again.

It is a strange feeling, walking down the mountain trail all by yourself. Even when the sun is high up, there is a darkness between the trees that cannot be dispersed. (if: $lastdeath is &quot;wolf&quot;)[

Eerie images flash in your mind and send shivers down your spine. You can&#39;t quite recall what happened, but the trees are there and you can smell your own fear in the air.] You feel vulnerable walking alone, even more so than before.

The shop, long and narrow, truly stretches inwards like the entrails of a giant beast, twisting left and right with openings occasionally appearing to either side, the weak yellowish light from the bulbs in a constant losing battle to the shadows sprouting everywhere. 

You vaguely remember this part and move through the motions, following your friend deep into the belly of her shop.


Eventually you reach a section where numerous dresses and overcoats are left hanging, followed by other old garments of all varieties.

$M[&#39;Hold on for a minute sweetie, I&#39;ll fetch a few things for you&#39;] She disappears somewhere between the rows.

It seems to be the most appropriate option. While you&#39;re not exactly a butler, you&#39;re part of the staff and at the service of the owner and the guests. This garment is the most befitting of your social ranking. Plus, the other option certainly doesn&#39;t look like something you would dare wear in public.

The room is exactly as you remember it. The sheets on the bed, the curtains on the windows, the tablecloth, even the carpet is made from a silvery silky-smooth material that gives the place an overall light-greyish tone. It feels like stepping in some eerie dream.

You step uncertainly on the $str[silky web]silver carpet, glancing at the $str[bones]sticks littered around the room. The nausea mounts in your throat and hits you like a truck. You fall to your knees.

$A[What the hell...]

You see yourself, $str[cocooned]tied on the bed, a giant silhouette of a black $str[spider]woman behind you, $str[descending from the ceiling]coming out of the wardrobe.

Without you noticing your hand has darted down between your legs, your fingers rubbing vigorously the wetness between your folds. 
It&#39;s something that you&#39;ve never done before.
No.

$a[&#39;So, uh, what brings you to The Crooked Elm?&#39;]

She continues to circle around you, visibly awkward and unsure. Her large butt wobbles softly, almost behind her body.

$a[&#39;Yeah, I get it. Just like me!&#39;] You laugh nervously. $a[&#39;That&#39;s the good thing about working at a hotel, right? You get a bed and a roof, even a breakfast...&#39;]

The woman blinks again and continues to circle around you. Feeling uneasy, you decide you&#39;ve outstayed your welcome.

$a[&#39;Hope I haven&#39;t disturbed you too much. Good luck for your kids!&#39;] You laugh again, nervously.

A howl tears through the night, long and piercing and, worst of all, right behind you. You switch into a sprint, running as fast as you can, but your $suit is uncomfortable for running and your feet get tangled in the extra garments you&#39;re not used to.

The book is old, but well preserved. On the cover, instead of a title, is writen in big, gothic numbers &quot;20-06-1763&quot;. You open a random page and find an odd, unrecognisable language:

What is really odd however is not the unfamiliar language, but the fact that however neatly, the book is clearly written by hand, the occasional ink dot punctuating the otherwise flawless calligraphy.

You place the book back and take another one, titled &quot;05-03-1648&quot;, only to find the same mysterious language and identical almost perfect handwriting. 

$A[It&#39;s rather unusual to find manuscripts these days... is this a family record? But then if it was some form of ancient Romanian, I would have been able to pick up at least a couple of words. Interesting.]

The dates stretch back a few hundred years at least, from what you can tell. The most recent title is &quot;02-01-1945&quot; and after that the records stop. There are, however, a number of untitled books waiting on the shelf.

When you enter the dining hall the room is already prepared, white table cloths with candlesticks covering all tables. Through the windows you can see the darkness beyond the manor, only the full moon&#39;s shadow peeking through the dirty glass.

Looking around, the place is completely desolate. You can&#39;t see any guests in sight.

$A[Ionut mentioned that there are only two guests at the moment, but this is still a little sad. Are they not hungry, or just busy elsewhere?]

On a table close to the window, Mihai is sitting alone, a glass of wine in his hand but no plate infront. He is the only person in the room. When he sees you he beckons you forward, gesturing a chair across from him.

You smirk and take the bait, sitting on the designated chair. There&#39;s nobody else around anyways, so you might as well talk to the eccentric owner. 

$Mi[So, Mr Reid, how do you find my hotel? Is it everything that you had hoped for?] Mihai&#39;s deep voice bears only the slightest of foreign accents, resembling more the intonation of a 19th century earl. Even now his golden headed cane is with him, leaning casually on the side of his chair.

You shake your head politely, raising your hands in an improvised gesture of apology. The owner nods dryly and doesn&#39;t insist.

$A[What an eccentric guy..]

Drinking wine alone in an empty hall may seem classy, but you suspect its just part of the façade that Mihai puts up to make his hotel more attractive to tourists. No doubt he expects you tell tales of the haunted manor and mysterious owner when you get back home, hopefully fooling some of your friends and relatives into checking out the place. Now that you think about it quite a few of the guys you know are gullible enough to at least hope there would be ghosts around the place, and no doubt the owner has arranged the occasional strange noise at night to keep the visitors coming...

All in all the place is quite inspiring for the right kind of person, if you forget for a moment that it&#39;s all just a front. With grim cynicism you dig into your dinner which Ionut has brought discretely on your table.

$a[&#39;There&#39;s clearly more to it than meets the eye&#39;] - you smile at the owner knowingly - $a[&#39;such an ancient manor full of history and mysteries is clearly the sign of a dynasty that goes back many generations. I looked around a bit and I can&#39;t help but be very impressed.&#39;]

Mihai nods but doesn&#39;t say anything.

$a[&#39;The building itself is more complex than is expected from a simple hotel, and I have no doubt that the towers that rise on top hold many family secrets. One even might wonder, Mr Petrescu, if your livelihood truly comes from guest fees...&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;I shall let you draw your own conclusions, Mr. Reid.&#39;]

$M[&#39;Quite so. A keen observation - like I told you, this is a demonic bracelet. It holds the power to protect its bearer from death. That power, however, is not unlimited. The crimson beads on top of it show you the number of times it can be used.&#39;]

&#39;So this means...&#39;

$M[&#39;Exactly. If there are only dark beads left, when you die - you die.&#39;(if: $bcharges is 0)[Sadly, this appears to be the case.&#39;] (elseif: $bcharges is 1)[But you have at least 1 left. That is good.&#39;] (elseif: $bcharges&gt;1)[But for now you should be fine.&#39;] ]

&#39;Is there- is there any way to recharge it?&#39; You swallow hard.

$M[&#39;Of course there is! Don&#39;t be silly - who&#39;d go through all the trouble of making a demonic bracelet - a rare, powerful and not to mention expensive artefact - if you couldn&#39;t even recharge it!&#39;  ]

&#39;Oh, thank God!&#39; You breathe a sigh of relief. &#39;So how do I recharge it?&#39;

$M[&#39;You need to devour the *energia vitalis* of a willing victim.&#39;]

&#39;But I-  I mean - there isn&#39;t anyone-&#39;

$M[&#39;Oh, I&#39;m sure a pretty girl such as yourself will surely have no trouble recharging her bracelet. It doesn&#39;t have to be a man, mind you, though you do need your victim to climax.&#39;]

&#39;Oh! Wait, if it doesn&#39;t have to be a man, then does that mean-&#39;

$M[&#39;Nope, forget about it.&#39;]

&#39;But I might **literally die!!**&#39;

The woman gives you a steel look, all the whimsical joy evaporating from her eyes. For a moment you see her irises stretch vertically, the shadows gathering around her...

You take up a summer job as a receptionist at The Crooked Elm hotel, which is also an ancient manor. When you arrive you meet with Mihai, the son of the owner and effectively your boss (also a vampire), and Ionut, the domestic servant (and also basically a mix between Igor and Frankenstein&#39;s monster). 

When you go down to the nearby village, you enter an antique shop and meet the owner, Felicia. She gives you an enchanted bracelet. On your way back to the hotel you get ambushed by a werewolf and die.

After your death the real game begins. You wake up as a woman (side effect of the bracelet) and start realizing you&#39;re in some shit. The goal of the game is to complete the day without dying (which is not easy to do). Each time you die your bracelet loses life charges and if you reach 0 it&#39;s game over. You can recharge it by draining sexual energy from victims (it&#39;s a succubus bracelet.)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="258" name="correct him drunk" tags="tavern" position="6721,6129" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$inn&lt;/div&gt;

You can&#39;t see very well the man who&#39;s speaking, but Lavius doesn&#39;t seem to like him at all.

You sit patiently on the table, waiting for Lavius to get back. You feel hot and sweaty, your mind in a happy haze from the wine. While you wait for your generous friend to return you sip nonchalantly from the expensive wine he bought for you. $A[&#39;Damn, this is a nice life!&#39;]

After a few minutes, he returns.

$L[&#39;I&#39;m terribly sorry for the interruption my dear, my *friend* over there needed my immediate council on a private matter. But I shan&#39;t bother you with such trifles. Now, where were we?&#39;]

Lavius leans in and kisses you again, filling your mouth with the taste of wine, lavender and something else, unrecognisable. When he draws away, you can&#39;t help but get a feeling of void.

$L[&#39;Let&#39;s finish the wine, shall we?&#39;]

The two of you finish the rest of the wine between more jokes and kisses. When the bottle is empty he takes your hand and leads you outside.

You have to admit that you&#39;re not paying too much attention where you&#39;re going, but after a while you leave the village and walk a short way towards the forest, after which the familiar silhouette of the $in[hunting cabin] appears among the trees. $L[&#39;We&#39;re almost there my love.&#39;]

You look around surprised. There are no other buildings in sight.

&#39;Lavius, I didn&#39;t take you for a hunter!&#39;

$L[&#39;A hunter? I am also that I suppose.&#39;] - he adresses you a strange grin. $L[&#39;But the place where we&#39;re going is not inside the cabin, but *beneath* it. Come, darling.&#39;] 

Wrapping a hand around your shoulders Lavius leads you around the cabin. The backside is just a dull wooden wall with no distinguishable markings. Your companion approaches the left corner and grabs one small twig sticking from the planks and gently twists it around. A portion of the wall caves in and slides away, opening to a flight of stone stairs descending somewhere into the darkness. Reaching a hand inside, he flips something with a loud *click!* and a row of lamps lights up, illuminating the passage with a yellow glow.

$A[Electricity!] Something inside your mind stirs, but you&#39;re too drunk to pay much attention to it.

$L[&#39;Welcome to my lair, love&#39;] says lavius, taking you by the hand and [[leading you down.-&gt;drunk 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="262" name="drunk 3" tags="lab0" position="5905,6664" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$lav&lt;/div&gt;

After a couple dozen steps the staircase ends with a heavy wooden door that Lavius pushes open. You step into a long hallway with a handful of doors to each side. There are more of the lamps spraying dirty yellow light around. Copper pipes run the length of the ceiling, punctuated with valves and pressure gauges. 

$L[&#39;Welcome to my secret laboratory!&#39;]

&#39;It won&#39;t be secret for long if you invite every girl to visit&#39; you chuckle.

$L[&#39;Perhaps, perhaps not&#39;] he replies with a mischievous smile.

&#39;And what&#39;s to stop from just anyone barging in anyways?&#39; you ask, strolling down the hallway.

$L[&#39;First of all, nobody knows where it is. And even if somehow they did, how would they get out once they&#39;re in? Nobody knows that the password is Lastra Mora&#39;]
$sc4[
$sys[You have learned a new secret: The Password]
(set: $secrets to (it +1)) ($nSecret: &quot;The Password&quot;) (set: $sc4 to false)]
&#39;Good of you tell me.&#39; You approach one of the doors - it has a small round window through which you can see a variety of chemical instruments and concoctions. &#39;What is all this, anyways?&#39;

$L[&#39;Ah, my dear, it is nothing that fits the tastes of a lady such as yourself. Come.&#39;] He takes your hand again and leads you down the hallway through several doors and down another flight of stairs. At the end of your short walk you end up in a small, dim lit room with a king-sized bed in the middle.

&#39;So is this your-&#39;

Not letting you finish, Lavius kisses you again, passionately, his lips stealing the breath from your lungs. It&#39;s a long kiss, a demanding kiss that takes everything you&#39;ve got and gives nothing back. Your body grows even hotter, lust flaring between your legs. He pushes you [[onto the bed.-&gt;drunk 4]]

You land flat on your back, the satin sheets cushioning your fall. He is on top of you, kissing your lips, kissing your neck, kissing your breasts, his hands tearing apart your clothes as he descends lower in a flurry of desire.

$a[&#39;What are you-&#39;]

He silences you with another brute kiss, completely shredding your $suit to pieces. Your naked body glistens in the darkness, beads of sweat covering your skin. Lavius runs his hands along it, feeling every curve. Reaching your arms, he places them in an outstretched position above your head and you soon feel the soft touch of leather wrapping around your wrists.

A fleeting hesitation crosses your mind. Should you really be doing this? You&#39;ve barely just met.

You giggle and relax your body, letting him tie first your hands and then your legs, pulling them apart. You feel completely defenceless and exposed, your flower twitching as he stares hungrily at it. $A[Maybe this is exactly what I wanted...]

He bends down and kisses it, leaving a trail of saliva along your slit. You feel that you can&#39;t resist him anymore. $A[Just take me already!]

Slowly, Lavius undresses in front of you. In the darkness you can&#39;t see much, but his body is clearly lean and muscular. When he&#39;s done he approaches you, sitting on the bed in front of you and wrapping his strong arms under your legs.

In the end your curiosity prevails and you follow Lavius&#39; request to stay around while he finishes whatever business he has with his friend.

When he returns you see him carrying an odd-shaped purple bottle, from which he pours you a generous glass.

$L[&#39;Let&#39;s call it a welcoming present for your arrival to our humble village. May it be just the beginning of many fine adventures for a fine lady!&#39;]

You blush a little, lifting the glass to your lips and taking a long sip. It&#39;s a strong, sweet wine with a fruity aftertaste that leaves you wanting for more. Within the minute you&#39;ve downed the whole glass and Lavius serves you another.

The haze in your head quickly thickens and the laughter, smiles and glasses seamlessly mix into one great (text-style:&quot;blurrier&quot;)[BLUR]&lt;blur|.

&#39;What are you-&#39;

He silences you with a brute kiss, completely shredding your $suit to pieces. Your naked body glistens in the darkness, beads of sweat covering your skin. Lavius runs his hands along it, feeling every curve. Reaching your arms, he places them in an outstretched position above your head and you soon feel the soft touch of leather wrapping around your wrists.

You begin to struggle but then a part of your mind seems hesitant. $A[Do I really not want this? My body is so hot, it would be so easy to just let him...]

The need overtakes you again and you begin bouncing up and down on your own, much to the men&#39;s amusement. The leader reaches and pulls your breasts out, allowing them to jiggle freely as you ride his cock.

It&#39;s hard to say what draws you to this man, even after what he did to you last time. The excuse you tell yourself is that you need to dig out more information. The way your heart rate increases when you look at those beautiful cruel lips suggests that this is not the whole story.

You casually walk past him and take a seat on a nearby table, making sure he can get a good view of your $breasts. You look away and start counting to 10 in your head.

$A[Seven, eight, nine...]

Right on cue, the exquisitely dressed figure of a man sits next to you. A bejeweled hand extends a wine glass towards you.

$L[&#39;Will the beautiful lady care for a drink? The beer really is dreadful in this place.&#39;]

You smile and take the glass from his hand. Your gazes lock for a moment, a static sparkling in the air as you see yourself undressed in his eyes. $A[Damn this cursed creature!] you think, trying to resist his charms.

$L[&#39;So what brings you to our humble village?&#39;] he asks, taking a small sip from his wine.

$z[&#39;So, what&#39;s the plan?&#39;]

You lean closer and whisper in his ear: $a[&#39;You know the old hunting cabin? It&#39;s actually Lavius&#39; secret lair. We can go in and out while he&#39;s busy drinking. Go and wait for me behind the back, I&#39;ll slip out shortly afterwards.&#39;]

$z[&#39;Alright, I&#39;ll meet you there.&#39;]

The two of you return to your normal posture and chit chat aloud about the beer and the village, trying to disperse any suspicion in case anyone was paying attention to your little exchange.

After a while, Zachary finishes his drink and leaves the inn. Nobody seems to care much about that. You stay behind for another 10 minutes, scanning your surroundings. $L[Lavius] is still at his table, drinking wine and chatting to some girl. The opportunity is ripe. Quietly, [you leave the inn.]&lt;vis|

After a brief descent you reach the wooden door at the bottom of the staircase. It&#39;s quite heavy, but this time $z[Zachary] pushes it and it easily opens.

The inside opens into a long hallway bathing in dirty yellow light from the electric bulbs. The walls are covered in copper pipes and valves with several large doors on either side. The air is heavy and humid, leaving a metal taste in your mouth.

$z[&#39;Strangely enough, this is exactly what I expected from Lavius. So, what are we actually here for? Some secret experiment? Are we going to steal his blueprints?&#39;]

$a[&#39;A-actually I just need the fuel from the generator...&#39;] you suddenly realise how stupid this must sound to Zachary. He just shrugs.

$z[&#39;Whatever you want doll, you&#39;re paying. So where can we find this?&#39;]

$a[&#39;Right here!&#39;] you point to the room on the left.

$z[&#39;Did you also happen to see where he keeps his generator while you were strolling through the forest?&#39;] Zach laughs, but nevertheless moves to open the designated door.

Inside there are a bunch of weird machines, though the electrical generator is easy to identify by its low humming and nest of cables going out to the rest of the contraptions. A few feet away from it are the metal barrels with flammable stickers on them.

$a[&#39;There, get one of those! They&#39;re too heavy for me.&#39;]

Zachary puts his back into it and lifts one of the barrels. Though he puffs and complains a little, it seems that the woodcutter is strong enough to carry it around without much trouble.

$z[&#39;I really hope you don&#39;t need anything else...&#39;]

$a[&#39;No, that&#39;s everything, let&#39;s go!&#39;]

$A[Time to get out of here before Lavius decides to visit his lair...]

Returning to the main hallway, you hear a faint noise coming from the depths of the laboratory, like voices calling out, though it&#39;s hard to make out over the electric buzz of the old yellow bulbs. A cold shiver runs through your spine and you feel the goosebumps crawling on your skin.

$A[Stay calm, Alexandra, you can do this!]

Unfortunately for you, the big exit door is now **closed**. $A[Damn, just like last time...] 

$z[&#39;What the hell, Alexandra, we&#39;re trapped!&#39;] Zachary drops the barrel on the ground and leans on the door, trying to push it open. It doesn&#39;t move and there is no handle on the inside. He runs his hands along the smooth surface, searching in vain for buttons or hidden mechanisms. There aren&#39;t any.

Trying to remain calm, you move towards the green digital screen with a small keyboard on the side of the door.

You carefully type $I[&quot;Lastra Mora&quot;] on the keypad. The device beeps a couple of times and the door slowly creaks open accompanied by the sound of hidden pneumatics.

$A[Phew! For a moment I was quite worried...]

$z[&#39;You have some questions to answer doll, as soon as we get out of here.&#39;] Zach picks  up the barrel again and you walk up the stairs together. When you exit the cabin and the hidden door slides shut behind you, both of you breathe a deep sigh of relief.

$z[&#39;So what now?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I just need you to leave the barrel...... at The Crooked Elm.&#39;] You certainly won&#39;t be able to bring the barrel uphill yourself, but judging by his expression, Zachary isn&#39;t too happy about it either.

$z[&#39;This thing is heavy, you know!&#39;] You give him a pleading look. $z[&#39;Fine, fine. I&#39;ll bring the stupid barrel to the hotel. You paid me well and I always keep my end of the bargain.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Could you fill the generator in the basement? It would be a life saver!&#39;]

He sighs again, then nods.

$a[&#39;Great! Thank you so much!&#39;] you jump with glee.

$z[&#39;Hope this was worth it doll.... take care, I&#39;ll see ya around. Don&#39;t get yourself into a mess, OK?&#39;] With the barrel on his back, Zachary heads uphill through the woods. $A[He probably knows some shortcut that would get him to the hotel faster...]

&#39;Why, most certainly. It will be right away.&#39; With a bow, the servant disappears into the kitchen.

$a[&#39;Don&#39;t worry, I got this!&#39;] you blurt out, rushing to replace Ionut at the sink. He gives you an odd stare as you snatch the wet dishes from his hands and get to work.

Some time passes while you work together, him giving you the dirty dishes and taking away the clean ones, while you slave away at the sink. A couple of times he brushes past you and you feel his large, strong body against your petite figure. You rub the dishes harder.

Occasionally, you catch Ionut staring at your... wrists while you do the dirty work. 

After a while, the work seems done. Ionut thanks you, vigorously shaking your soapy hands. You smile at him, a little frustrated. $A[Was I expecting more?]

You feel his large, strong body pressed against your petite figurine as he hands you the dirty dishes and takes away the clean ones.

His crooked limbs are full of muscles and his twisted torso is like chizled out of a block of granite. If he wanted, Ionut could crush you in an instant.

The thought is somehow making you even more excited. You decide not to take any chances this time. 

Your body is reacting and nipples are so hard and aroused that every movement makes them rub against the fabric of your shirt.

Your heart pounds faster with every passing second.

It&#39;s not a conscious decision at first, but your feet take you closer and closer towards the silhouette until you can clearly see one another. 

The creature looks like some sort of feral man, hunched and mutated, with a hairy body and long, sharp claws on his hands. He cocks his head to the side as it eyes you up and down. You can hear him sniff the air intently, his body tensing and ready for action.

You&#39;re close enough that the smell hits you, a bestial smell of sweat and mucus that is both repulsive and attractive in its repulsiveness. Your body responds to it with a growing hotness an a light-headed feeling that borders on euphoria.

The creature takes a step towards you and your eyes fall down to its giant erection. $A[This is bad!! If I don&#39;t do something, that thing is probably going to tear my clothes to shreds and take me, I mean rape me...]

In the few heartbeats you have to react, you take the only logical way out by dropping to your knees and offering the beast your open $lips. It doesn&#39;t wait for an invitation and sticks its member inside your mouth, grasping your hair with its abnormally large hands.

It turns its head towards you, pinning two hungry yellow eyes straight at its new target.

The creature looks like some sort of feral man, hunched and mutated, with a hairy body and long, sharp claws on his hands. He cocks his head to the side as it eyes you up and down. You can hear him sniff the air intently, his body tensing and ready for action.

You&#39;re close enough that the smell hits you, a bestial smell of sweat and mucus that is both repulsive and attractive in its repulsiveness. Your body responds to it with a growing hotness an a light-headed feeling that borders on euphoria.

The creature takes a step towards you and your eyes fall down to its giant erection. 

$A[Damn it, I used too much pheromones!]

Your error is clear now, but it&#39;s too late to fix it. The intentions of the beast are clear and you doubt you can outrun or dissuade it. On one hand, attempting to flee can at least save you some face and if you don&#39;t manage to escape, you&#39;ll know that at least you&#39;ve tried.

It hardly seems the most appropriate moment, but a mysterious phenomenon requires investigation. You slowly unbutton the top of your pyjamas and take it off.

$A[Woah...]

You stare mesmerised at your breasts. They&#39;re small and cute, reminding you of an Asian girl that was once in your class. Your nipples are dark and... sensitive, you observe, touching them lightly with the tip of your index finger. The sensation is warm and somehow electric, different from anything you&#39;ve known so far. 

You trace a hand on your flat belly, admiring the softness of the skin.

$A[So this is what it&#39;s like to be a girl...]

Your gaze falls down, following the train of thought. You can tell that something you&#39;ve grown used to is missing, though there is a new, alien sensation in its place.

Tentatively, you dip a hand in your panties and run your fingers underneath yourself. There is an explosion of new sensations and you quickly draw away.

$A[Well that was... something..] you think to yourself, blushing despite being alone.

You have so many questions and so few answers. You munch your food in the candle-lit penumbra of the dining hall, when the strange woman comes in and sits at Mihai&#39;s table.

As a student, (link:&quot;you&quot;)[(goto:&quot;You&quot;)] have decided to take a gap year to see the world and get a better sense of what you want in life. 

After some searching you stumble upon an add in the paper that offers the job of a receptionist at a hotel in a small mountain Village in Romania.

You pack your bags and head on a long trip, eventually crossing over Europe and arriving at your destination.

Getting off the bus, you look around. The village itself is very small - barely a few dozen stone houses at best. The mountain air is clean and fresh, filling your nostrils with the scent of old pines and green moss. Save for a few electric lamps barely illuminating the street, it doesn’t look very modern. Judging by the architectural style, it hasn&#39;t moved in the last few centuries. 

Unable to locate the hotel, you talk to a strange man who sends you upwards a mountain trail, going along the river. The path is steep and it&#39;s getting dark, but after an hour of walking, you eventually arrive.

The hotel is an ancient manor several stories high, a central part and two wings with several towers and balconies looming over the mournful garden. It’s hard to make out everything in the darkness, but you estimate it has at least two dozen guest rooms, perhaps more. 

$A[Wow... the place must have been a real luxury resort back in the day, perhaps then the village was a popular tourist destination? A shame, now it reeks of disuse and decay... Could be a cool place to stay, but I doubt they get many visitors.

On the bright side, my job as a receptionist is probably going to be a whole lot of sitting around, waiting and doing nothing. Perhaps I could go back down to the village and find a pub, befriend the locals? Or maybe get back to that book I&#39;ve always wanted to write?] 

There is a fence around it, with a gate that is locked. You shout out but nobody answers.

The man looks half amused by the question, but then gives you a stern look.

$rando[&#39;None of your business, sweetheart. Now why don&#39;t you bugger off and let the **men** do their business.&#39;] His companions give you equally sour looks, one of them toying with a dagger.

He stands up and grabs you by the wrist, jerking you to follow as the two of you head towards the far end of the hall. There, he shoves you inside a small storage room filled with boxes and barrels. You&#39;re forcefully pushed against the wall, where you meekly place your hands, and wait passively as he slides down your panties, rubs your wet hole a few more times and then has his way with you unceremoniously.

When he reaches climax you sense a warmth around your wrist, one of the bracelet&#39;s black pearls blossoming into crimson. The hooded man groans, filling you with a different kind of warmth.

$A[Damnit!!]

At least you tried. It&#39;s little consolation, but it&#39;s all you have. Despite your body&#39;s burning heat, you still tried to resist. You didn&#39;t want this. As the beast&#39;s erect member pokes under your garments, you know there&#39;s nothing left to do.

You step into a long hallway with a handful of doors to each side. There are more of the lamps spraying dirty yellow light around. Copper pipes run the length of the ceiling, punctuated with valves and pressure gauges.

You head to the far end of the garden, where you last saw a large patch of thistles growing by the cemetery gate.

Using a swiss knife you have the habit of carrying with yourself, you cut some of the violet thistles. They&#39;d make for a pretty bouquet, though a bit thorny.

&#39;What can you tell me about this?&#39;

You pull out the tiny green bottle, handing it to the shop owner. She flicks it through her fingers with an expression of faint surprise on her face.

&#39;I didn&#39;t steal it, it was a gift!&#39;

You peer into the poisonous green bottle. If it is what you think it is, you could just pour it into someone&#39;s glass...

&#39;What can you make of it?&#39; you ask the owner.

$M[&#39;The easy option would be to use it as an enhancer in a standard amulet. The amulet can absorb the benefits of the potion - speed and strength - and grant them to you in a milder, safer, and more permanent way. If I add a little extra, it might even last through your death...&#39;]

&#39;Oh wow! So I will permanently become very nimble?&#39;

$M[&#39;Effectively, yes. You will be quicker, more enduring, and with improved reactions in certain situations.&#39;]

&#39;Certainly sounds useful. But you mentioned this was the &quot;easy&quot; option. What else can you make out of it?&#39;

$M[&#39;There are a few things, but I&#39;m currently missing the ingredients. I&#39;ll try to look around and we&#39;ll talk then.&#39;]

$M[&#39;Right now, I can either use this to make an amulet of quickness, or you can keep it for later.

You feel like the cat is driving a hard bargain, but having that amulet might just be worth it. Reluctantly, you hand it over and whisper two of your secrets to her.

Her expression remains neutral as ever, not giving away anything. 

$A[Did she already know this? What games is she playing?]

You are left with more questions than answers, as usual. The owner smiles mysteriously and leaves you to wait, dissapearing somewhere in the depths of her shop. 

There is an eerie sensation of time stretching and condensing, like a bubble gum being chewed by a lazy panther. You have no idea where that mental image came from, but for some reason it sticks in your head. The minutes stretch, thick like honey, and the hours flow, quick like a mountain stream.

After 5 minutes, according to the mechanical clock on the wall, the antique boutique regurgitates its owner back to the reception.

$M[&#39;This is for you,&#39;] the cat says, handing you a small metal amulet on a string. It looks like a golden spider, with a green gem in the middle. $M[&#39;You can decide when to wear it and take it off.&#39;]

$a[&#39;It&#39;s kinda complicated, and I&#39;m not sure I understand everything myself.&#39;]

You take a deep breath and start recounting how you arrived here at first and the strange events that lead to your current situation. You tell her about the bracelet and about Felicia, but try to leave out some of the details regarding the secrets you&#39;ve found. You still don&#39;t know exactly what her relationship is with the other characters in the village and you&#39;d rather not open any unnecessary weak spots.

Then comes the tricky part, your relationship with Elise.

(if: $Elise_choice is &quot;friend&quot;)[$a[&#39;We were friends, then. Two women trying to survive in the world. You told me about your children and how you were looking for a home for them.

The tension hangs in the air.

$E[&#39;Ahahaha!&#39;]

The worst thing is that you know what&#39;s going to happen. Somehow, you are still present. Not truly awake, but not deep in the endless darkness like last time. This time, you can still think, slowly and hazily. You can still feel your body, with vague and muffled sensations, as if it&#39;s a distant memory, something that happened a long time ago, far away.

You feel Elise&#39;s presence too, in the darkness of your mind&#39;s eye. The long thin legs dangling around you, her imposing body looming somewhere above. 

Your movement ceases and you know you have arrived at your final destination. You feel a small opening being torn at the back of your cocoon, and the spidery presence abruptly draws closer.

$E[&#39;Tsk. Do you think we can just let humans like you learn everything about us?&#39;]

You try to thread carefully with your next words.

$a[&#39;She isn&#39;t like you, Elise. You are big and strong, and you are cunning... you can take care of anyone that tries to get in your way.&#39;]

Elise seems flattered by your words.

You seem to have pacified Elise, at least for now.

The ovipositor prods your body and for a moment it seems to hesitate where to go, but then it settles on your back entrance. The thin tube-like organ presses down and easily overcomes the resistance of your relaxed muscles, sliding inside you.

You realize that part of you is anticipating the action. Whether it is the spider venom or your perverted mind, you&#39;re almost looking forward to it. 

It&#39;s comforting to know that it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s not your fault that you&#39;re enjoying it, and it doesn&#39;t change anything.

A hard, round object presses against you. Despite knowing what it will do to you, you realize how much you want it inside. The end begins to stretch you open and despite your relaxed body it struggles to get in. 

As the pressure slowly increases you sense your hole growing wider. In your half-awake state you dream of wolves under the full moon and nights of lust and passion.

When the round object is halfway through, there is a brief moment of equilibrium, a stillness as you lie stretched and waiting. Then the tipping point comes and it sinks a millimeter further, after which your body takes over and greedily sucks it all the way in.

There is a sudden and intense wave of pleasure, along with sensation of fullness in your gut.

You take a stroll along the dusty shelves, trying to follow the source of the voice. Sometimes it&#39;s undeniably getting stronger, but just when you think you have it, it starts fading again.

After a long game of cat and mouse, you eventually reach a strange place at the back of the library, where the tomes look especially old. One of them in particular draws your attention - you&#39;re either going crazy or it&#39;s the source of the voice.

As soon as your fingers touch the ancient covers you feel a strange electric sensation run through you. This is not an ordinary book.

You turn the front page - it&#39;s covered with odd symbols and diagrams that are moving and shifting in front of your very eyes. Just looking at them gives you a headache. 

$A[Reading this is going to be a complete nightmare! But who knows what secrets may be hidden inside...]

You turn the pages and are immediately engrossed into a world of ancient stories of secrets and madness. The words seem to come alive on the page and before you know it an hour has passed and your mind is filled with tales of horrors you have never heard before.

With a trembling hand, you close the tome.

$A[They&#39;re right to say that knowledge has a price...]

For all that you&#39;ve learned, you feel that your grip on reality is a little looser. The shadows in the corner of your eye seem to be watching you, waiting for a moment of carelessness to strike at your back.

You feel like you&#39;ve lost a portion of your $clarity[sanity], but you&#39;ve learned a few $M[secrets].

You leave the library in a hurry.

You don&#39;t know why, but you feel like showing Felicia some of the flowers you found in the garden of The Crooked Elm.

As soon as you pull them out, her eyes widen and she pounces on them, snatching them from your hand and running off somewhere inside the Antique Boutique.

$a[&#39;Hello...?&#39;]

There is an eerie sensation of time stretching and condensing, like a bubble gum being chewed by a lazy panther. You have no idea where that mental image came from, but for some reason it sticks in your head. The minutes stretch, thick like honey, and the hours flow, quick like a mountain stream.

After 5 minutes, according to the mechanical clock on the wall, the antique boutique regurgitates its owner back to the reception.

$M[&#39;Let&#39;s forget this ever happened.&#39;]

Felicia straightens her clothes and returns behind the counter.

It seems the servant has finally taken the hint and you feel him get his  cock out of his pants and start rubbing between your thighs. His breath is right behind your ear. 

You put the plate down and spread your legs apart obligingly, helping him get to the sweet spot. 

His member is rough and misshapen like the rest of his body. As it slides inside of you you can feel the bumps and irregularities. It slowly stretches you more and more, until it&#39;s all the way in. 

Thick and twisted.

There is something excitingly wrong as you feel the odd shape inside of you, the rough bumps triggering points of pleasure you didn&#39;t even know existed.

You let the servant wrap his muscular hands around your hourglass figure and rock you violently back and forth like an animal. You push a plate and it breaks, but neither of you care.

The early morning rays seep through the stained window glass, warming your face. You wake up with a sudden movement, rising in your bed. 

$a[&#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39;] you say out loud. There&#39;s no one to answer.

There is a brief period of confusion, than the memories flood your mind. Lavius, Felicia, Elise, Mihai, Ionut. Death by fangs and acts of desire. It all seems so distant, so surreal. 

$A[Was it all a dream? I feel weird...]

You look down at yourself, feeling your body.

$A[That&#39;s odd, I&#39;m still a woman... Did I manage to break the cycle? Or did time reset again?]

You hastily grab your phone from the night stand.

$A[It&#39;s TUESDAY! I made it, I survived!]

It seems that you&#39;ve managed to pull it off after all. You expected to be turned back by now, but perhaps Felicia can help you with that. Now that you&#39;ve escaped the loop, it should be just a formality.

You leap from a bed and start getting dressed, when a glimpse in the mirror [[catches your eye]].

$A[&#39;What the bloody HELL?!&#39;]

In the mirror, a beautiful young creature stares at you. She has a pair of small white horns sticking out of her head.

Your hands dart up and sure enough they&#39;re there - a tiny pair, barely a few inches out of the skin. They feel hard and rough, almost like stone. You stand awestruck, refusing to acknowledge reality.

$a[What is happening to me?]

With your heart racing, you sit back on the bed, trying to catch your breath. You&#39;ve seen a lot of weird things around here already, but this strikes too close for comfort. It isn&#39;t the first time your body has changed, but so far you&#39;ve always been.... human, you suppose. 

And now you&#39;ve become [[something else]].

You are no longer human. The thought just pops in your head, both frightening and arousing you. You can&#39;t tell why, but you are absolutely certain of it. 

If you have horns now, perhaps there are other changes to your body as well. You&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re brave enough to know. But then again, you have to.

Fighting with your rising panic, you decide to take a moment and assess the situation. 

Of course, the first thing that you can&#39;t ignore are your horns. Small and curly, they barely stick out through your hair, but are nevertheless impossible to miss. Looking at yourself in the mirror you can&#39;t take your eyes off of them.

You gently touch them - your horns are rough and hard, with a coarse texture. Still, the tip is pointy enough to prick your finger.

Moving on to your face, not much has changed from what you last remember - you still have $hair, $eyes, soft white skin and $lips. You are drop-dead gorgeous. 

On your chest, you can&#39;t really tell if your $breasts are the same, but they feel perhaps a little bigger and softer. What does feel different however is you touching them - even from a simple and non-sexual examination of your own body you can feel goosebumps and tingles on your skin, and your nipples are already growing hard.

$A[I should be careful with this... I don&#39;t want to get myself into embarrassing situations]

It&#39;s crazy how in a moment like this you&#39;re focusing on your clothes, but somehow they feel important. They&#39;re like your armor for taking on the world.

$A[Is Mihai that careless or does he really trust me?]

You are a little puzzled by this oversight, but decide not to question your luck.

Ionut makes a step towards the front door and you follow, trying to keep balance. The damned thing sways a little, as if the content is liquid. Taking breaks every dozen steps or so, the two of you manage to get it through the front door and into the garden.

$a[&#39;Ionut, where are we going?&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Not var now,&#39;] he replies, panting with effort.

The servant heads down the familiar path along the side of the manor and towards the basement. It takes you a few more minutes of grunting to get there, but the box is finally in front of the basement door.

Mihai&#39;s footsteps echo faintly in the darkness above and you decide that the distance is enough to tail him safely.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/environments/attic_door.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; &gt;
You follow the winding staircase up, walking blindly by keeping a hand on the cold stone wall. The darkness is just as impenetrable as last time, and you begin to wonder if what you&#39;re doing can really be considered wise.

$A[There is something at the top of the tower, something big. I should be careful...]

You remember a glimpse of a giant winged shape, just moments before Ionut knocked you out cold. You shiver at the thought. $A[Funny how things turned out with Ionut, despite that little accident...]

The sound of Mihai&#39;s footsteps is suddenly gone and you realize that he must have reached the top of the tower. Which means that you will too.

You slow down your progress to a crawl, placing each foot down as carefully and as silently as you can. Eventually, you reach the door leading to the top of the tower. There is a draft blowing in your face. You reach forward, but your fingers grasp only darkness...


$A[Mihai must have left the door open... this will make it easier to hear what they&#39;re talking about.]

This is clearly way too dangerous to be worth a few overheard sentences. Last time you climbed into the tower, it cost you your life. 

$A[Perhaps I can try again, when Mihai isn&#39;t there?]

You&#39;re not certain what good can this do either, but at least you won&#39;t run into **two** vampires at once.

You glance at Ionut, judging his reaction. $Io[&#39;Vell, can&#39;t say-&#39;]

$a[&#39;Not a tank then. A reservoir? Oh, I know! An aquarium!&#39;]

You look at the servant again, he seems to be trying his best poker face, which isn&#39;t going &quot;vell&quot; for him at all.

$a[&#39;What&#39;s in the aquarium, Ionut?&#39;]

The servant looks away. You remember his earlier words about the new guests and your face lights up.

$Io[&#39;Alrigt, vine! It iz a mermaid.&#39;]

You consider this. With everything that you&#39;ve already seen around her, perhaps you shouldn&#39;t be expecting to find Ariel. You remember the mermaids of the old myths, luring sailors to the rocks and feeding on their bodies with long sharp teeth....

You fall on your knees and let him unbuckle his belt, taking the misshapen cock in your mouth. You give him a wet, sloppy blowjob with more eagerness than is really required. At the end, just when you can feel him hard and throbbing, the servant pulls out, emptying his load on your generously exposed tits.

The servant&#39;s eyes grow wild and he lifts you up in the air, spinning you around. Suddenly you are placed face down on the old work table and the servant is on top of you. Before you can say anything his cock rams into your petite ass with more passion than you ever thought possible for such an old man. His weight pushes you down and you just have to take it, waiting until he&#39;s done.

After several minutes you finally feel his warmth inside of you, and he rolls off, allowing you to breathe again.

20 or so minutes pass uneventfully while you still try to compose your thoughts after the conversation with Elise. The only sound in the reception is  the distant chatter of the guests in the dining room. The long hallway muffles them, so you can&#39;t make out any words, but they seem to be enjoying themselves.

You pause for a moment and scratch your head. Did you miss it? The narrow front of the shop was barely noticeable, squeezed between two stone houses. You make a 180 and head down the main street again, looking even more closely at the narrow spaces between buildings.

The Antique Boutique is not there.

The beast pushes on top of you with its full weight, forcing your head down in the mud as your ass raises to accommodate it&#39;s giant member. 

However much you try to take control, your body craves it. It needs it. Your $breasts are bouncing freely with every thrust of the beast, moans escaping your $lips despite your best efforts.

$A[How can this feel so good?]

Your tail, which isn&#39;t your tail, curls up obediently as the beast finally tenses up, its member inflating inside you. 

There is something primal, bestial deep inside of you, that is now $a[**awakening**]. The creature bites down on your neck, locking you into place and you feel a series of spurts shoot deep inside your womb. The bracelet glows hot on your wrist, a new bead blossoming crimson as your body absorbs the life energy.

The desire grows inside of you, rising like a tidal wave that threatens to wash over your entire mind. You want to succumb to it so badly, though the last remaining voice of reason warns you that it may have dire consequences. You&#39;re not sure if you really care at this point.

A powerful thrust from the beast finally breaks you. A long, animalistic howl escapes your throat, echoing among the darkness of the pine trees.

The werewolf keeps you in place as more spurts spill from its inflated knot. Your mind succumbs to the overflowing pleasure as a pink haze drowns all remaining thoughts.

Through the darkness of the forest, other howls answer yours in the distance. Your body shivers from fear and excitement. Something is about to happen.

Even as the werewolf is still finishing up with you, you see a number of yellow eyes observing you among the trees and bushes. 

Unphased, the beast does one final thrust, before leaving your body to collapse on the mossy earth.

You lie on the ground on all fours, head bowed down and ass up in the air as the pack of wolves [[emerges from the darkness]].

Trying your best to keep a fragment of control, you resist the unspeakable urges inside of you and remain quiet, letting the creature do its thing.

The werewolf keeps you in place for a few more minutes, until his knot finally deflates and he plops free from you. A drip of semen spills to the ground, overflowing from your used pussy.

With a dizzy head, you slowly recover from the experience. The smell of wet earth is mixed with the musky aroma of bestial sweat and sex. A wave of guilt and shame overcomes you.

When you finally manage to get up, your legs shaking, the beast is nowhere to be seen. Without you realizing, the devil gown has returned to its normal shape, a long elegant dress covering your figure in the splendor expected from a dancing hall. 

Your shaking walk is the only indication that anything happened at all.

$Mi[&#39;I see,&#39;] he says briefly.

$Mi[&#39;I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re safe and sound, my dear Alexandra. It&#39;s true that our village can sometimes be a dangerous place.&#39;]

Ionut brings you the frigărui, which you dig into while Mihai keeps sipping from his glass. 

$Mi[&#39;My father used to say that the only way to hold everything together is through fear and discipline. Unbreakable rules that must be followed.&#39;]

You look up at Mihai. There is a distant gleam in his eyes.

$a[&#39;But you are not your father, are you Mr. Petrescu?&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;I think this place has grown stagnant over the ages. It&#39;s time to usher in a new era.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Uhmm...&#39;]

The owner looks at you and gives a small laugh. $Mi[&#39;Forgive me my dear Alexandra. I must bore you with my incomprehensible ramblings. Eat for now. There will be more guests coming tomorrow.&#39;]

Just when you&#39;re about to enter your room, you hear a strange little voice behind you.

$M[&#39;Psst, o&#39;er here!&#39;]

In the darkness, two green eyes are peering at you. The black cat approaches into the light.

$a[&#39;Uhm, Hello?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Evening, darling. You&#39;ve made it this far. Good job. Just don&#39;t let it go to your head.&#39;] The voice echoes in your head, with a smooth jazzy tone that is a little surprising coming from a small feline.

$a[&#39;Do I know you?&#39;] You look at the tiny creature. It looks just like an ordinary alley cat.

$M[&#39;You know my mistress, if you didn&#39;t already guess that.&#39;] He - for the voice is now undeniably male - manages to look down on you patronisingly despite the height difference.

$a[&#39;Right. So, uhmm... what do you want?&#39;]

The cat looks you up and down. $M[&#39;I don&#39;t *want* anything, darling. Just here to lend a helping paw.&#39;]

You look at him, puzzled.

$M[&#39;You never know when you might need a good outfit. I say this in your best interest.&#39;]

The cat turns away from you, heading towards an open window. $M[&#39;Gather more secrets. I&#39;m sure you can find a way.&#39;] He leaps through the window, disappearing onto the rooftop.

Your wolf ears lay low and your tail curls up in readiness.

$A[Damn this devil gown! It got me into this mess on purpose..!!]

The realization does too little too late. The Alpha jumps on you first, while the others watch and wait respectfully around him. 
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/wolf_pack.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; &gt;

An actual wolf feels much smaller and weaker than the creature before him, but you moan all the same. In fact, you can&#39;t help it. It is as if you&#39;ve completely lost control over your actions.

The bracelet glows incredibly hot, and so do the different parts that of the transformed devil&#39;s gown. You suddenly feel something appear on your back, right under the wolf&#39;s belly.

$A[What- what&#39;s going on? Dammit, I can&#39;t focus, can&#39;t think!]

Your mind is a complete and total haze and you don&#39;t fully understand what&#39;s going on. Once the Alpha is done with you, he steps aside, leaving the rest of the pack to have their turn. 

After a while you lose track of beasts that have had their way with you, everything mixing into a blur of sweat, sex and howling.

You are alone in the forest. The seconds drip by slowly like the juices down your thighs. Eventually, the cool mountain air brings some clarity back to your thoughts. You should move.


[[Get up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="594" name="phero.overdose2" tags="" position="5637,4263" size="100,100">

The creature is looming over you. It&#39;s close enough that the smell hits you, a bestial smell of sweat and mucus that is both repulsive and attractive in its repulsiveness. Your body responds to it with a growing hotness an a light-headed feeling that borders on euphoria.

The creature takes bends over you and your eyes fall down to its giant erection. 

$A[Damn it, I used too much pheromones!]

Your error is clear now, but it&#39;s too late to fix it. The intentions of the beast are clear and you doubt you can outrun or dissuade it. On one hand, attempting to flee some more can at least save you some face and if you don&#39;t manage to escape, you&#39;ll know that at least you&#39;ve tried. On the other hand, if you cooperate perhaps things will go down a lot smoother for you...

You already know what&#39;s going to happen, and it&#39;s driving you crazy.

The fabric becomes liquid gold, flowing down your skin under the silvery moonlight. Just like before, it leaves most of your body naked, condensing into a fluffy tail and a pair of wolf ears perking out of your hair.

The heat inside of you flares again, your unprotected crotch pointing at the beast. How did you find yourself in this position again?

The beast enters you with a growl, stretching you wide with a single thrusts. He&#39;s too big, way too big for you, but your flesh stretches and adapts with unnatural ease, letting the werewolf&#39;s giant phallus plunge deep inside you.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/scene1.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

$A[Alex, why are you doing this to yourself?]

This time, it&#39;s your own fault. There are few excuses that you can make to fool yourself. But that&#39;s something to think about later. Right now, your [[hips are opening willingly]].

The beast pushes on top of you with its full weight, forcing your head down in the mud as your ass raises to accommodate it&#39;s giant member. 

You no longer try to take control, your body craves it. It needs it. Your $breasts are bouncing freely with every thrust of the beast, moans escaping your $lips despite your best efforts.

$A[How can this feel so good?]

Your tail, which isn&#39;t your tail, curls up obediently as the beast finally tenses up, its member inflating inside you. 

There is something primal, bestial deep inside of you, that is $a[**awakening**] again. The creature bites down on your neck, locking you into place and you feel a series of spurts shoot deep inside your womb. The bracelet glows hot on your wrist, a new bead blossoming crimson as your body absorbs the life energy.

The desire grows inside of you, rising like a tidal wave that threatens to wash over your entire mind. 

You want to succumb to it so badly.

You want to give up. 

You want to give in.

If you didn&#39;t want that, you wouldn&#39;t be here again. Resistance is futile.



[[Howl with pleasure-&gt;howl2]]

A long, animalistic howl escapes your throat, echoing among the darkness of the pine trees.

The werewolf keeps you in place as more spurts spill from its inflated knot. Your mind succumbs to the overflowing pleasure as a pink haze drowns all reason.

Through the darkness of the forest, other howls answer yours in the distance. Your body shivers from excitement. 

Even as the werewolf is still finishing up with you, you see a number of yellow eyes observing you among the trees and bushes. 

$A[They are waiting for me.]

Unphased, the beast does one final thrust, before leaving your body to collapse on the mossy earth.

You lie on the ground on all fours, head bowed down and ass up in the air, inviting the beasts to [[emerge from the darkness]].

$A[Why did I get myself into this mess again ?!]

The realization does too little too late. The Alpha jumps on you first, while the others watch and wait respectfully around him. 
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/wolf_pack.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; &gt;

This time your wings appear instantly, blossoming on your back like a red flag to let all the males know that you&#39;re in heat. You can feel your reason draining out and being replaced with deep, insatiable lust.

$A[More! I want more!]

Once the Alpha is done, the pack descends upon you. This time there is no order. As soon as one jumps you, another approaches your face. Helpless, you part your lips and let him hump your mouth, swallowing the salty semen.

The next one misses your pussy and plunges in your ass, though you don&#39;t seem to mind. Your body can accommodate anything. 

After a while you lose track of beasts that have had their way with you, everything mixing into a blur of sweat, sex and howling.

It&#39;s a little past noon and you are alone at the reception.

$A[Something very strange is going on...]

Currently Lavius, Elise and the werewolf (in fluffy slippers) are having a late breakfast with Mihai in the dining room. You somehow doubt that all of them have gotten together just for a friendly chat. 

You don&#39;t know how long they will be at it, but it probably will give you some free time before you have to take care of the guests.

$A[But before I worry about them, perhaps I should find Felicia to see what&#39;s going on with me...?]

You glance at the front door. With your increased speed, you can make it down to the village and back to the mansion in about an hour.

(if: $merfed is 0)[Then again, Lavius did ask you to feed the creature in the box, and Mihai will probably expect you to take care of things like this.

You point to an all too familiar corner of the room.

$a[&#39;There was a group there yesterday. I think they were friends of Lavius. Do you know where they are?&#39;]

&#39;Looking to have some fun are you girl?&#39; the bartender gives you a dirty look.

You make your way to the corner and approach the hooded figure.

$a[&#39;Mind if I sit?&#39;]

Zach looks up and you can see his eyes darting left and right around the room.

$z[&#39;Whatever it is, make it quick.&#39;]

You sit on the bench beside him, trying your best not to draw any more attention.

$a[&#39;Why the secrecy?&#39;]

$z[&#39;Because of your silly stunt, that&#39;s why darling!&#39;] he answers angrily. $z[&#39;Word on the street is Lavius has found out that someone broke into his lair and he&#39;s furious. I haven&#39;t seen him all day and his goons are missing too, so you can bet your pretty ass that they&#39;re up to something, and probably trying to find out who did it.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Zach, would you know where I can find Felicia? The owner of the antique boutique.&#39;]

$z[&#39;She&#39;s a tough one to find, doll. I imagine she didn&#39;t leave a note on her shop?&#39;]

You give a nervous laughter. $a[&#39;Not only is she gone, the whole shop is gone with her! It&#39;s like it never existed...&#39;]

Zachary sips from his tankard, deep in thought. $z[&#39;I believe you, doll. You are smarter than you look, and I&#39;ve heard enough rumors about this place.&#39;]

$a[&#39;But you don&#39;t know where to find her, do you?&#39;] you look at him with desperation. You realize just how much you&#39;ve come to rely on your feline acquaintance.

$z[&#39;Look for a place with books,&#39;] Zach whispers in a low voice. $z[&#39;I doubt her shop will pop-up in a cave or something. Chances are it will latch to another building. Perhaps that will help, but what do I know?&#39;]

He takes another sip, pulling his hood down. You decide to leave Zach alone before your little duo starts drawing unnecessary attention.

Strolling down the other hallway you emerge at the small game room. It has tall windows overlooking the garden, as well as a number of small tables surrounded by armchairs. Of course, the central feature is the old pool table, which is currently occupied by the two players.

$L[Lavius,] dressed in the finest velvet, is skipping around with a glass of wine in his hand. On the other end the $W[werewolf], currently in his human form and still wearing his bath robe and bunny slippers, is trying to aim a trick shot while puffing on a large cigar. 

The two of them seem to be in the middle of a heated discussion, but their voices hush as they see you approach.

$L[&#39;Well, well, well, if it isn&#39;t the beautiful damsel from the reception! Tell me, my dear, do you play pool?&#39;]

Truth is, you used to play with your friends back in the day, but it&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve had any practice. You wonder whether to boast your skills or to keep that information to yourself.

$L[&#39;Splendid! In that case, we can have a little competition! We do have some time to kill after all&#39;]

The werewolf rolls his eyes at Lavius, but doesn&#39;t seem to care all that much. Ignoring his annoyance completely, the vampire sets the balls into place.

$L[&#39;Loser owes a favor, agreed?&#39;] he grins. $L[&#39;You can start first of course.&#39;] 

It&#39;s pretty easy to see what Lavius wants, but despite your hindsight into his true nature you decide to play along. $A[I can probably beat him with some luck...]

Unfortunately for you, Lavius seems to be pretty good. He lets you score a few times, but quickly overtakes the table with precise shots that clear his balls while leaving yours in devilishly tricky positions.

As he walks past you for another shot, his hand rests comfortably on your waist. The $R[hunger] that has been growing in you since morning is now nearing a peak. Your belly is burning hot and you find it increasingly difficult to concentrate.

$A[Damn, it&#39;s like my own body isn&#39;t listening to me...]

Lavius&#39; hand slides from your waist down to your butt. Without thinking, you press against him, allowing him to get a good feel of it.

You take another shot, missing the ball completely. 

$L[&#39;It seems that it&#39;s not your best day, my dear!&#39;] exclaims Lavius with such a sweet voice that you barely catch his mockery. $L[&#39;And now it&#39;s time to pay your due. Perhaps you would like to take a brief walk with me in the library?&#39;]

The werewolf rolls his eyes at Lavius, but doesn&#39;t seem to care all that much. Ignoring his annoyance completely, the vampire pulls you closer to the table and begins walking you through the basics of pool.

$L[&#39;You have to hold it like this,&#39;] he explains, positioning your hand while leaning behind you. You can smell his perfume float towards you, the warmth of his breath at your neck as he showers you with sweet nothings.

It&#39;s pretty easy to see what Lavius wants, but despite your hindsight into his true nature you still quickly find yourself under his spell.

$L[&#39;Only Mihai would think to put a creature like **you** into something like this...&#39;]

Eventually he manages to get your ass bare, still holding you firmly in place. His hand runs down your slit, testing its wetness.

$L[&#39;Always wet and willing... that&#39;s the best thing about the succubae!&#39;]]

Not wasting any time, he enters you eagerly, placing a hand over your mouth to silence your moans. You feel ashamed by the pleasure he is able to inflict upon you, even against your will. You try to keep some control, but fail miserably. The $R[hunger], building up since morning, is now entirely in control of you. Like an animal in heat, your hips push back with his rhythm, helping him reach his climax [[in a few short minutes]].

Sitting at the floor of the library you slowly compose yourself and get dressed again. Lavius has already gone, though you seem to have momentarily lost track of time.

A few things bubble to your conscious attention. First, the $R[hunger] that has been increasing all day has finally subsided. What is worrying however is that even if the urges have gone down, your mind still feels very hazy. In fact, it even feels $A[hazier] than before.

You feel as if you&#39;re a little drunk and concentration takes an effort. You know you should probably be more alarmed by this, but in your current state all you can do is quietly note the phenomenon.

Another thing that you notice is that your bracelet hasn&#39;t changed, despite the recent &quot;feeding&quot;. This is also something that should perhaps worry you.

Back on your feet again, you finally manage to regain some of your focus, though it&#39;s clear that something isn&#39;t quite right. 

The library is quiet.

Suddenly there is a tingling sensation at the back of your head. You turn towards the distant end of the room - the rows of shelves seem almost never ending.

$A[Did someone- did someone call my name?]

You hesitate.

Walking down the dusty aisles you begin to experience a strange sensation, one that you have felt before. There is something wrong with the space around you. The lines of the aisles somehow bend in weird ways, straight paths loop back into themselves.

The further you go, the stronger the feeling becomes. The air is thick and still like glass. The bits of dust hang frozen in the distance, illuminated by rays of still light.

You follow the gut feeling, turning left and right. You reach a point where you make 4 consecutive right turns, which should have looped you around a shelf... but instead you come across a [[familiar desk]].

You blink at the catwoman, trying to shake the mist from your head.

$a[&#39;It&#39;s hard - thinking...&#39;]

$M[&#39;I&#39;m sorry about the confusion - getting into this place requires some extra distortion. But let&#39;s face it - you aren&#39;t in the best of shapes either.&#39;]

$a[&#39;What do you mean?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Take your time, darling. You can do this.&#39;] Felicia pats you gently on the head.

You pause, composing yourself. Your thoughts feel like noodles floating in a giant bowl. Then finally they straighten up a little. Last night, the loop, the bracelet. The missing Antique Boutique. Which isn&#39;t missing anymore - because you&#39;re somehow standing right inside of it. Inside the library. 

You shake your head. It&#39;s probably better to take this one thing at a time.

$M[&#39;That&#39;s not what I said,&#39;] pouts Felicia. $M[&#39;You can&#39;t return to normal while in the loop. But breaking it doesn&#39;t automatically reverse things.&#39;]

You give a sigh. You thought you were close, but now it sounds like there&#39;s still more to do.

$A[&#39;Okay - can you turn me back now?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Nope.&#39;]

$A[&#39;Why not?&#39;]

$M[&#39;You&#39;re not a woman anymore, you&#39;re a succubus. Thought you might have noticed.&#39;]

Felicia gives you a funny look. $M[&#39;That&#39;s right. It seems that you&#39;ve used the powers of the bracelet one too many times. There&#39;s a limit a mortal body can be pushed to, and you lasted longer than most.&#39;]

$A[&#39;So... what now?&#39;] you ask, desperation creeping in your voice.

$M[&#39;There is still hope. Hope to return to normal... or hope to be happy with your current condition. You seem to be enjoying it quite a bit.&#39;]

You look away from the catwoman.

$A[&#39;It has had its moments...&#39;] you trail of, blushing.

Your mind shifts into the $a[haze] again, dreaming of all the things that happened. Thinking is hard again. With great effort, you focus on your present situation.

$M[&#39;I understand,&#39;] Felicia nods. $M[&#39;succubae are not naturally intelligent creatures. They are led by lust and carnal desires. Now that your physical transformation is accelerating, so is the mental one.&#39;]

You swallow hard. $A[&#39;Does this mean...?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Yes. If you&#39;re not careful and give in to your desires, you can easily end up as a mindless sex demon.&#39;]

It should have been frightening to hear that, but instead you feel an arousal bubbling from the the depths of your belly. The image of a succubus in heat fills your mind. She is a slave to the pleasure, willing to do anything and everything...

$M[&#39;Hey, snap out of it!&#39;]

Felicia gives you a quick slap on the face, bringing you back. 

$M[&#39;I can&#39;t have you like this, you&#39;re no use. Hold on a moment.&#39;]

She turns away and dissapears somewhere between the bookshelves.

$M[&#39;I&#39;ll have to dig through some books - your predicament is rather rare if I have to be honest. I expected you to either be cured or die before the transformation goes any further. You&#39;ve managed to accomplish quite the number of time loops...&#39;]

Felicia scratches her head, pensive. 

$A[&#39;I&#39;m sure you can think of something...?&#39;] You look at her hopefully.

$M[&#39;It should be possible, but I&#39;ll need to do some more research. In the meantime, try not to go overboard with the deaths, OK?&#39;]

You give a small nod, still trying to focus your attention. The warmth beneath your legs is growing, $a[screaming] for attention. You struggle to focus.

Time runs and stands still in the eerie frozen light of the library. You can&#39;t tell how many minutes pass before the mysterious catwoman emerges behind the counter again.

$M[&#39;Here, this should help clear your head a little.&#39;]

She&#39;s handing you a steaming cup of tea. You take it, bringing it up to sniff it carefully. It smells like a forest after rain, mixed with something fresh that you can&#39;t quite put your finger on.

As you down the cup, the mist in in your mind clears away, as if blown by a gentle breeze. Your thoughts calm down and it becomes easier to concentrate.

You slowly blink, as if waking up from a dream.

$clarity[You&#39;ve regained some sanity!]

You make your way back the winding passages of the library. Eventually the aisles become straight again and the light form the windows no longer stays frozen in the air. 

With a sigh of relief, you return to the game room.

Currently, there is no one there, but an ampty glass of whiskey and a cigar butt. $A[Damn, look at the time! It&#39;s [$hour:$minute]&lt;time| already! Mihai mentioned that there would be a meeting of sorts in the evening...]

$Io[&#39;No! Mihai vaiting. You go, now!&#39;]

The servant grabs your wrist and pulls you back. You are yet again reminded of his incredible strength - he could easily move you around without breaking a sweat.

Resigned, you bow your head and walk back to The Crooked Elm.

$A[Where is everyone?]

If you hadn&#39;t been late, you would have known where to go.

You start to panic a little. You better find where they are and hope your late arrival is forgiven.

You take another tour of the ground floor, just to make sure. The kitchen and dining room, the game room and the library. Everything is silent.

Climbing on the first floor, you make the rounds. Not a sound. The hotel is eerily still. You knock on $Mi[Mihai&#39;s room], but no one answers.

You go to the second floor and try $E[Elise&#39;s room]. It&#39;s unlocked, but she isn&#39;t there. You try the other doors, with no luck.

Your only option is now the attic. You climb up and listen. The silence is even deeper.

$A[Perhaps in the tower?]

You head to the end of the hallway, then pause. You are forbidden to go in there. But the gate is unlocked. 

You take a deep breath and climb the stairs. At the top, the tower lays in utter darkness. There is no one there.

Confused, you go down again.

You&#39;ve checked every room in the hotel.

You step in the garden, looking up at The Crooked Elm. All the lights are out. The place looks like it&#39;s completely uninhabited.

You rub your eyes, holding your head in your hands. $A[Think, Alex, where can they be...]

Pacing back and forth in the garden, your gaze falls on the last place you haven&#39;t checked.

The basement.

You notice yet again that the inside of the &quot;basement&quot; actually resembles a dungeon, with a cold stony floor and pillars supporting the manor on top. 

There are several torches burning,  which illuminate the room just enough.

$A[Odd choice, given that the electricity is running...]

As before, you notice the pipes and valves covering most of the east wall and going into the ceiling, as well as a handful of crates, a workbench and some tools hanging near it; more torches and cobwebs wobbling by the cold draft; and of course, there is the generator.

The $in[box] that you left there earlier is nowhere to be seen. Looking around however, you spot an arm sticking behind a pile of boxes.

You go through the door and creep down the corridor. There are more torches burning to the side.

You go past a few junctions with smaller passageways branching to the sides, but they are darker and silent, so you press on the main path, speeding your step up.

At the end of the corridor you come upon a heavy wooden door. There is light seeping around the corners, and voices coming from inside.

You sigh with relief. $A[This must be where they&#39;ve gone... I should warn them about Ionut, perhaps someone can help.]

You push the door open and step inside.

$a[&#39;Sorry for being so late-&#39;]

The words freeze in your mouth, the eyes turn towards you. $L[Lavius], a silver dagger in hand, is looming over a body, which lays lifeless face down on the stone floor, dark blood forming a pool around it.

$L[&#39;Hello, darling, you&#39;re a little late to the party,&#39;] Lavius turns towards you with a sinister smile. $L[&#39;But don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll take good care of you.&#39;]

On the side of the scene, you see a big, bestial figure, standing half-upright with an arm in its jaws. There is a big splatter of blood on the wall behind, and you catch the edge of a golden cane, sticking out of the mess.

$A[Mihai...] you gasp.

In the far end of the room, you catch a number of silhouettes lurking in the shadows, rugged familiar faces grinning back at you.

Your heart racing in your throat, you turn around to flee. The doorway is blocked by a tall, dark figure.

$a[&#39;Elise! You have to help me, they have-&#39;]

You interrupt your sentence, seeing the cold light in her eyes.

$E[&#39;I&#39;m sorry sweetheart, it really isn&#39;t personal,&#39;] she says with some bitterness in her voice. $E[&#39;I wish things could be different, tsk. What a mess.&#39;]

$A[This can&#39;t be dangerous, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t let me do it alone. But then again...]

You&#39;ve been left in plenty of perilous situations, so you don&#39;t feel all too reassured right now.

You circle the box cautiously. It looks pretty well sealed, but you finally manage to find a few clips and latches which hold the lid. After some work, it seems to be free.

You carefully lift the lid of the box. As you expected, it&#39;s filled with water. 

You stand on guard, expecting something to jump or slither out... but nothing happens. You allow yourself to take a better look, peering directly on top of the surface. It&#39;s only water... as far as you can see. It feels like staring into the infinie depths of the sea.

You take a piece of meat you drop it into the box. It starts sinking, further and further down, until it slowly disappears from view.

You drop the rest of the meat and close the lid. It&#39;s an unsettling experience that your mind has some trouble dealing with.

You try not think about the box.

The owner gives you a small nod. $Mi[&#39;I will be in room 11 should you need me.&#39;]

With that, he climbs the ornate stairs, the tapping of his cane quickly muffled by the carpet. You are alone at the reception.

You head down the main street towards the inn, when something catches your eye. The small facade of the antique boutique is not where it used to be. To your surprise, the two tall buildings that you distinctly remember on either side of the boutique are now right next to each other, with no space in between.

You pause for a moment and scratch your head. Did you miss it? The narrow front of the shop was barely noticeable, but still. You make a 180 and head down the main street again, looking even more closely at the narrow spaces between buildings.

The Antique Boutique is not there.

$A[What the hell is going on...?]

You stroll down the street for a third time, but to no avail. The feeling that something is off keeps getting stronger. Perhaps someone at the inn could help shed some light on the situation?

Of course, the first thing that you check are your horns. They seem to have grown larger, with big curves sticking out of your head. Looking at yourself in the mirror you can&#39;t take your eyes off of them.

You gently touch them - your horns are rough and hard, with a coarse texture. Still, the tip is pointy enough to prick your finger.

Moving on to your face, it is also somewhat different - you still have $hair, $eyes, soft white skin and $lips, but your features have changed. It&#39;s subtle, but it&#39;s there. You are $A[devilishly gorgeous]. 

On your chest, you can&#39;t really tell if your $breasts are the same, but they feel perhaps a little bigger and softer. What does feel different however is you touching them - even from a simple and non-sexual examination of your own body you can feel goosebumps and tingles on your skin, and your nipples are already growing hard.

(if: $second_chance is 1)[$I[As you look at yourself in the mirror, you notice that there is something on your back. It looks like some sort of symbol has been tattooed on it, but you can&#39;t see it very well. You decide that for now, it&#39;s the least of your worries.]

]Then, there&#39;s your mind. You can already sense the $A[haze] and the $A[hunger] creeping back. You remember your last conversation with Felicia.

$A[I should be careful with this... if I use my powers too much, I&#39;ll end up like a mindless sex toy...]

You try to ignore that arousing thought. Right now you have more pressing matters. You need to figure why the events from last Tuesday happened, and how you can prevent them.

$A[Okay, no time to lose... I need to find what&#39;s going on. Where do I start?]

You try to think who you could trust. Someone who isn&#39;t trying to kill you, someone who won&#39;t betray your secrets. The group of people narrows down to one.

$A[The only question is, do I go now, or later?]

You stare at the manor in the grey morning light. There&#39;s bound to be *something* unusual going around. Something that you missed last time. You could look around.

You follow the gut feeling, turning left and right. You reach a point where you make 4 consecutive right turns, which should have looped you around a shelf... but instead you come across a familiar desk.

You tell her in as much detail as you can the events that happened before your reset. The catwoman listenes attentively, interrupting only for the occasional question.

$M[&#39;It seems I was right - Lavius is up to something no good. I knew that the bastard was scheming.&#39;]

Her eyes twinkle with a deadly spark.

$A[&#39;So what do we do?&#39;]

The woman seems thoughtful for a long moment.

$M[&#39;I guess it&#39;s also time for me to tell you a secret.&#39;]

Drawn by curiosity, you decide to pick up the book. It has a hard black and red cover, with the title $R[Tales of love and horror].

Opening the book, you notice a handwritten note on the first page:

Felicia laughs. $M[&#39;I somehow doubt they make it out to tell the tale. In any case, I suspect that whatever he&#39;s making is related to his sudden action. He wouldn&#39;t make a move without a reason. So you must go and find out more.&#39;]

It&#39;s a beautiful day in the mountains, the clear path by the stream cheerful and sunny despite the twilight between the trees. As long as you don&#39;t wander into the actual forest, all will be well.

You make your way down, enjoying the silence of nature and the scent of pines. The moment is so peaceful you&#39;re almost ready to forget your troubles.

Making your way down the steep forest trail, you finally emerge at the village. The familiar group of stone houses nested together at the mountain slope initially look unchanged, but you quickly pick up that things are not the same as before.

Just like last time, the usually lethargic village is now somehow restless. There are people moving hurriedly through the village center and an almost tangible sense of tension in the otherwise calm mountain air. Something is definitely going on.

$A[I wonder if I should ask Zach for help with this one...?]

You don&#39;t bother with the inn or even the main road, circling directly to the hunting cabin, and the entrance to Lavius&#39; secret lair...

$A[I can probably take care of this on my own!]

You feel confident, despite the hazy clouds in your mind.

You go behind the cabin and unlock the secret door. As you walk down the stairs, you remember another time, when Lavius walked with you. For all of his shortcomings, the bastard did show you a good time..

After a brief descent you reach the wooden door at the bottom of the staircase. It&#39;s not locked, but heavy enough that you have to lean on it with both hands to push it. Your feminine body and slender arms aren&#39;t as strong as you&#39;re used to.

The inside opens into a long hallway bathing in dirty yellow light from the electric bulbs. The walls are covered in copper pipes and valves with several large doors on either side. The air is heavy and humid, leaving a metal taste in your mouth.

$A[Looks exactly as I left it...]

You walk down the hallway, the electric buzz filling your ears. The machinery is alive, busy with some strange works.

$rando[&#39;You shouldn&#39;t be here...&#39;] comes a voice behind you.

Startled, you turn around to see a man that is vaguely familiar.

A sudden and intense pain brings you back awake. 

You are sitting on a chair next to a wall. Your wings have appeared again, and someone just nailed one to the surface behind you.

$a[&#39;Aaaargh!&#39;] you cry out.

The figure looming above you steps back into the light, and you recognize tha man from the inn. Before you can say anything he leans in and forces a nail through your other wing, securing it in place.

You cry out again and begin to struggle, but your hands are tied and any movement causes a sharp pain in your wings.

You whimper as he places a few final nails in your wings.

The man grabs your top and tears ot open, exposing your breasts. With a swift movement, two metal clamps click around your nipples, sending a jolt of pain through your body.

An electric shock hits your breasts, causing your entire body to shake.

It hurts, but it in a good way. As you recover from the zap, you are surprised to feel that your groin is growing wet.

Another shock hits you, sending waves of pain and pleasure through your spine. The $A[hunger] that was at bay for a while is now growing strong again. Your thoughts are becoming cloudy.

The next shock sends you into the beginning of an euphoria. You feel lightheaded and numb.

You meekly shake your head, struggling for words. Your only hope is to wait for death and reset. If they learn your secrets, they could keep you a prisoner forever.

$rando[&#39;Open your legs, sweetheart.&#39;]

To your horror and shame, you comly with his request. The metal slides easily in your already wet pussy. Soon after, the next shock comes, this time stimulating you from all sides.

$a[&#39;Aaaah!&#39;] You moan with pleasure. You never believed that it could be forced upon you like this. 

Another shock comes, and you can sense that they&#39;re increasing the voltage. Your mind starts going blank. You are unable to think straight.

With the next zap, you start climbing towards an orgasm.

The man grabs you by the hair and shoves his cock in your mouth. You begin sucking obediently, unable to help yourself.

Completely defenceless, you give in to the pleasure, [[reaching an orgasm-&gt;torture 4 drunk]].

At the same time, something strange happens. You can&#39;t explain how you know it, but you can see. Vivid as day in your mind&#39;s eye, the bracelet loses one of its (colour:&quot;#FFCCCC&quot;)[crimson beads].

If this keeps on like that, you might lose all your charges.

However the horrifying reality of the situation is still not enough to sober you up, and the next shock sends you moaning back into pleasure.

The conversation quiets down. Mihai will probably leave the room soon. And run directly into you.

You could go down, now. With some luck, Mihai won&#39;t hear you and you&#39;ll be on your way without anyone suspecting that you were ever here.

Alternatively... Your mind races. The corridor is pitch black. You could probably slip inside the room quickly enough, without Mihai noticing anything.

A slap on your face brings you back awake. 

You are sitting on a chair next to a wall. The figure looming above you steps back into the light, and you recognize the man from the inn, who had his way with you while his buddies watched. But that was in another lifetime, while you were still human.

Your memory is a growing mess. You blink at the man, confused.

There is an edge in his voice, a danger that sends your mind on high alert. You test your arms - they are tied behind your back. You can&#39;t move.

$rando[&#39;Aye, you aren&#39;t going anywhere, better get comfortable darling.&#39;]

You try to calm down and observe your surroundings. You are in a room filled with various contraptions, no doubt still somewhere in Lavius&#39; laboratory. There is a single yellow bulb illuminating the man in front of you. Squinting beyond the electric halo, you notice his friends, leaning behind in the shadows... There are four of them, and you are alone and tied up. The situation isn&#39;t looking good.

As quickly and quietly as you can, you make your way down the spiraling staircase, careful not to trip in the darkness.

Eventually, you see the light of the exit and emerge back into the familiar hallway of the attic.


$A[Phew! That was a little too close for comfort. I better hurry and head downstairs before Mihai makes it down as well.]

You breathe deeply to calm your racing heart and pretend that nothing has happened. $in[Your gut tells you that you have gained a piece of valuable information, even if you&#39;re not yet sure how to use it.]

You can feel every beat of your heart resonate in your throat.

$A[Calm down, Alexandra.... even if Mihai can see in the dark... you are behind the door, he won&#39;t notice you...]

The owner&#39;s footsteps approach closer and closer. You can hear the gentle tapping of his cane on the wooden floor of the room.

The door swings shut as Mihai passes by. Only after you hear him descend calmly down the stairs do you finally allow yourself to breathe.

You exhale a deep sigh of relief.

As you predicted, the two guests are already there.

$L[Lavius,] dressed in the finest velvet, is skipping around with a glass of wine in his hand. On the other end the $W[werewolf], currently in his human form and still wearing his bath robe and bunny slippers, is trying to aim a trick shot while puffing on a large cigar. 

The two of them seem to be in the middle of a heated discussion. This time, you try to pay attention and manage to catch the last bits of the exchange:

You eye them up and down. There is nothing in Lavius&#39; charming smile that hints at the atrocities that he&#39;s about to commit tonight. But you know.

The werewolf on the other hand seems very nonchalant about the whole thing. $A[They seemed to be discussing something important, perhaps their plans for tonight... I wonder if I can learn more, or even intervene in any way...]

You suddenly realize that the two of them may not necessarily be in complete agreement. Perhaps you could try and divide and conquer this tricky situation?

They exchange looks.

Lavius is polite as ever, but you can tell from his look that he&#39;s firm. The other guest puffs from his cigar, disinterested in the conversation.

Suddenly the fibers of the devil&#39;s gown start melting and the garment reshapes in front of your very eyes. Bewildered, you find yourself in the outfit of a Russian ballerina. Your hair turns blonde and your waist shrinks to the tiniest possible size.

$Io[&#39;Natasha!&#39;] exclaims Ionut with wide eyes.

Suddenly you know what to do. You bend over the table, lifting the miniskirt up and exposing the cutest little butt in the world. Ionut grabs you with eager hands, pressing his cock against the petite asshole.

(if: $lewd&lt;70)[$a[&#39;Uh-uh,&#39;] you say with a teasing, cruel voice, clenching it tight. $a[&#39;Talk first, fun later.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Good boy!&#39;]

You relax and let him in. He rams his big misshapen member in with such vigor and readiness as if the entire Bolshoï Theatre is watching his performance. It doesn&#39;t take long until you can feel his warm seed spill inside of you. 

$Io[&#39;Natasha,&#39;] mumbles the servant again. $Io[&#39;I have to go now.&#39;]

The servant seems unconvinced. $Io[&#39;I can&#39;t do that,&#39;]

Your $suit probably really isn&#39;t the best option to get a reaction from Ionut.

You glance at Ionut. $Io[&#39;Yes, that is correct-&#39;]

$a[&#39;So it must be important to him, to go through all the trouble.&#39;]

You look at the servant again, he seems to be trying his best poker face, which isn&#39;t going &quot;vell&quot; for him at all.

$a[&#39;Why is it so important, Ionut?&#39;]

The servant looks away. You remember his earlier words about the new guests.

$a[&#39;**Someone&#39;s** in the aquarium, right Ionut? Why does Lavius bring another guest?&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Alrigt, vine! It&#39;s a friend of his. Someone he cares about.&#39;]

$a[&#39;A friend? So am I!&#39;] you exclaim. $a[&#39;Can I see her? I would love to talk about our mutual acquaintance.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Of course it&#39;s a **her**! This is Lavius we are talking about.&#39;] you laugh.

Ionut considers this and shrugs.

You want to get out, you have to get out. But you can&#39;t. Your limp and lifeless body lies on the path, under a starless sky.

There is no wind in this place, no animals, no flowers. Only roots going down, into eternity.

You feel a dark presence coming along the path and stopping a few feet away.

The game starts and you quickly realize that you are deerily mistaken. The vampire is playing on an entirely different level than before. He shoots with elegance and precision that any pool master would be envious of. What&#39;s worse, you can tell by the gentle smirk on his face that he isn&#39;t even giving his best.

$A[Damn, if this continues I don&#39;t stand a chance! I need to think of something if I want to win...]

He has barely taken his first few shots but you already realize that there is a big gap between your abilities.

The conversation goes as before and you do your best not to give anything away.

You take the moment to circle the pond and find a bench that is sheltered away from the eyes of the manor. No one can see that you&#39;re here.

Sometimes it can feel that you are always on the run, that time is pressing you to make choices and to act now. But here, the quiet rustling of the mountain reminds you that you can always take a moment for a deep breath.

When it&#39;s your turn to shoot, you brush past Lavius, making sure that your breasts rub against his shoulder. Then you lean on the table, bending forward.

You don&#39;t really need to take that long to aim, but you want to make sure that your short skirt is lifting as far up as possible. When you finally take your shot and turn around, you catch Lavius&#39; hungry stare stuck on your ass.

$A[Good, the strategy seems to be working!]

On his next turn, the vampire takes more time than usual, but still manages to pocket his ball.

Lavius may pull of better shots than you do, but there may be a way to outsmart him. 

You carefully observe the positioning of the balls on the table.

$A[If I let him have this one, and then I hit that one over there, then he might get himself into a trap and accidentally pocket the 8 ball... yes, that might work...]

On your next shot you try it again, but just can&#39;t seem your trajectories right. You try to position the 8 ball to get in his way, but you end up pocketing it instead!

He grabs the top of your dress and rips it apart, yanking your whole body forward. Your nailed wings scream in pain. Pieces of the gown fall down as your breasts are exposed to hang naked in the air. 

$rando[&#39;You&#39;re a succubus, right? These must be extremely sensitive...&#39;]

He pinches and twists one of your nipples, stealing a moan from your lips. You don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s the influence of his device or the strange relationship with pain that you&#39;ve developed, but these horrifying things are also horribly turning you on.

It&#39;s extremely embarrassing. You know that he knows that he&#39;s turning you on.

It&#39;s your best bet to get away with it. Lavius is a total womanizer, so you hope that your story sounds credible enough.

$rando[&#39;Yer a persistent one... but worry not, we have ways of making you talk.&#39;]

After some rummaging in a corner the man produces another device, which he places on the table next to you.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/torture3.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
He approaches you with two wires, ending with pincers. You know where this is going, and you don&#39;t like it.

He tears away the rest of your dress, leaving your upper torso completely naked. Then he attaches a pincer to each of your nipples.

$rando[&#39;Look at me, girl,&#39;] he says in a low voice, lifting your chin up. $rando[&#39;Believe me, this gives me great pleasure. But I will make it easy on you if you cooperate. And if you don&#39;t...]

His hand reaches under between your thighs, caressing your slit. $rando[&#39;We&#39;ll make this looong and painful.&#39;]

You give a quiet whimper as his finger enters your wet hole.

$rando[&#39;Let&#39;s begin, boys!&#39;]

It begins with a soft tingle, which grows slowly. You expected pain, but instead you&#39;re getting something... pleasant.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/torture4.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
The pleasure continues to grow, kindled by the quickening pace of his fingers down your crotch. Despite your best efforts, the heat in your belly is growing.

$rando[&#39;You&#39;re a good little bitch, aren&#39;t you? Don&#39;t worry, we can make you scream in more ways than one...&#39;]

The tingling increases, feeling like tiny needles sticking under your skin. There is some pain, but in your current state it only heightens your arousal.

$a[&#39;Aaah!&#39;] you cry out, failing to conceal your pleasure.

The man&#39;s fingers plunge all the way inside your wet hole, stretching you open.

$rando[&#39;Good little bitch! We&#39;ll break you, then we&#39;ll make you talk, then we&#39;ll break you again, just for the sport!&#39;]

He reaches to the device, turning a knob up. The tingling rises sharply, the needles growing into knives.

$a[&#39;Aaaaaaah!&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/torture3.5.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
The sudden increase of stimulation pushes you over the edge, and your body shakes with a powerful orgasm.

$rando[&#39;This bitch came all over my fingers!&#39;] exclaims the leader, still pushing his hand deep inside of you as you keep cumming, your juices wetting the chair underneath you.

His subordinates erupt into laughter, visibly excited. Some of them seem eager to have fun with you as well.

As your body finally stops shaking, you feel a sudden **cold** around your wrist.

Even without looking, you can tell that **your bracelet has lost one of it&#39;s crimson beads!**

You aren&#39;t sure what just happened, but in an instant your pleasure turns into panic. You only have $bcharges left! If this continues, you will have none remaining, and then your life will truly be in the hands of these bastards.

One look at their leader tells you that they aren&#39;t letting you walk out of here alive.

He doesn&#39;t let you sit and think on this though. Before you&#39;ve even recovered from your orgasm, he turns the device on again.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/torture3.5.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
You are climbing up with excitement again, the loss of your bead only further increasing your $a[hunger and desire].

You can&#39;t wait to be ravaged by these scoundrels, to be taken over and over again and used like the little fucktoy that you are.

As it stands, this is exactly what&#39;s going to happen. Unless you do something, right now.

With your legs the only part that isn&#39;t tied up or nailed down, you reach out and kick the device on the table, managing to jostle the knobs considerably.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/torture3.9.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
The power surges through your body, amplified tenfold.

Every muscle that you have contracts in agony.

After a few seconds that seem like an eternity, your heart gives up, overwhelmed by the current. Your pain peaks then subsides, your vision blurring.

Your plan was successful.

You follow the gut feeling, turning left and right. You reach a point where you make 4 consecutive right turns, which should have looped you around a shelf... but instead you come across a familiar desk.

On it, there is a small note:

$M[*I&#39;ve gone hunting for information. Will be back soon.

You blink at the piece of paper. It&#39;s written in violet ink that smells faintly of... roses and catnip?

The early morning rays seep through the stained window glass, warming your face. You wake up with a sudden movement, rising in your bed. It is Tuesday again. You didn&#39;t go back too far.

You take a deep breath. It&#39;s going to be a long day.

You head back from the library, returning to the gaming room.

Lavius raises an eyebrow with you.

$L[&#39;Did you miss us already?&#39;]

Now that you think about it, figuring out what does two are up to might be your best bet right now.

$a[&#39;I&#39;m still looking for someone to accompany me for a walk.&#39;]

Clearly, you need to distract Lavius even more if you want to have any chance of winning.

You lean on the table again, making sure that he has a generous view.

$a[&#39;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m holding the cue right... can you give me a hand?&#39;] you ask, turning back towards him with a coy look.

Not needing a second invitation, Lavius jumps to the opportunity. He wraps his arms around you, adjusting your grip on the cue. 

$L[&#39;There, if you can just hold it like this...&#39;]

As his body is pressing against yours, you can feel his erection poking against your butt. Your body grows hot as well, the $a[hunger] in you demanding to be satiated.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pool0.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;  align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You feel aroused, but so does Lavius. If you push just a little further, it might be enough to win the game...

You bend a little lower, rubbing your butt up and down at Lavius&#39; crotch. It&#39;s easy to tell that the poor chap is hard as a rock...

$A[There, that should do it!]

Now it&#39;s time to take your shot. You position the cue and aim for the ball...
...when you feel fingers brushing along your slit. A shiver of pleasure runs up your spine and the wetness between your legs grows stronger, soaking up your panties.

$L[&#39;Come on, dear, it&#39;s your turn. Take your shot...&#39;] 

In an instant, the vampire has turned the situation around.

$W[&#39;Can you get it in that hole or not?&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pool0.2.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;  align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Looking up, the werewolf is smirking. You&#39;re not sure if he&#39;s talking to you, or to Lavius, and the vampire&#39;s fingers are growing bolder by the second. Your face reddens as one slips inside of you...

$L[&#39;Tell you what, darling, I&#39;ll make you an amazing offer. If you get this shot in, I&#39;ll concede the game. What do you say?&#39;]

The offer seems too good not to take it up.

You meekly follow his advice, keeping your shoulders square and your legs sperad apart. He spreads your entrance with two fingers and before you can even think of protesting, he&#39;s inside of you.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pool1.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;  align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
You have handled Lavius before. You have already prepared for the heat in your belly, the sensitivity of your breasts, the $A[need] of that spot deep within that you long him to reach.

What you are **not** prepared for is the pitiful smirk on the werewolf&#39;s face as he watches Lavius [[have his way with you]].

$W[&#39;You are surprisingly impatient for a man of your age, Lavius.&#39;]

A hard cock is inside of you and currently that&#39;s all you can think about. The room is spinning and your holes are burning with desire. You try to focus on the cue and the ball, but your hand is slipping.

$L[&#39;And you choose to sit and watch surprisingly often for a man of your vigor, my friend.&#39;]

The pace is quickening and your hips are bouncing back, grinding against the man behind you. You want it and you want it now. Clenching your teeth, you take your shoot.

$W[&#39;I had a rough night, what can I say.&#39;]

Your hand slips, the ball misses. You don&#39;t care anymore.

With a final, deep stroke, Lavius finished inside of you. There is an explosion of pleasure and another beed blossoms on your wrist.

Your head is spinning.

The vampire gives you a cheeky look.

$L[&#39;Once, when I was young, I had a wonderful time with two succubae, such as yourself. As a parting gift they offered me a little artefact, a tool of the pleasures of the flesh.&#39;]

He opens the ornate box and carefully pulls out... a small butt-plug.

You roll your eyes, trying not to chuckle.

$a[&#39;I suppose they also offered you demonic lube.&#39;]

$L[&#39;I expected someone like you to be able to spot an item of power right away. I am disappointed.&#39;]

He locks your gaze and you can tell there isn&#39;t a trace of jest in his eyes.

$a[&#39;What does it do?&#39;] you ask in a small voice.

$L[&#39;When it&#39;s inserted in a willing *victim*,&#39;] he licks his lip, $L[&#39;it cannot be removed, except by the one who put it there. And as long as it stays in place, her arousal increases with every hour. It&#39;s quite delightful to observe, actually.&#39;]

You swallow hard as he turns the little plug in his hand.

You lean on the table not without a hint of eagerness, letting your panties slide to the floor. Having something inside of you that you will have **no** control over sounds both frightening and incredibly exciting.

Lavius smacks your ass and presses the plug between your cheeks.

$L[&#39;Are you ready, dear?&#39;]

Not waiting for your reply, he presses down and you feel it gently stretch your hole, sliding deeper and deeper inside. Soon the widest part is right at the threshold, and with just another small push and a little whimper from your lips it softly slides all the way in, lodging in place.

$L[&#39;There, all done. You quite enjoyed that, it seems!&#39;] he says gleefully, tracing a finger along your wet entrance.

$a[&#39;H-How long do I have to keep it in?&#39;]

$L[&#39;As long as I decide, sweetheart! You lost, now you have to bear the consequences.&#39;]

Your butt feels surprisingly full for such a small thing. There is an odd feeling emanating from it, it&#39;s almost... *spicy*.

You wonder if the plug really can&#39;t be taken out, or Lavius is just taking you for a ride. $A[Even if it really is enchanted, I **am** a succubus after all, perhaps it won&#39;t effect me?]

$A[How hard can this be...?]

You clench your butt, attempting to push the object out. It&#39;s an odd sensation. For such a small thing it&#39;s surprisingly hard to bulge.

As you put more strength in, it&#39;s almost as if the harder you push, the bigger it becomes, lodging itself just after your little butthole. Your efforts become excruciating as the object starts swelling and pushing against your inner walls.

Despite your best efforts, you&#39;ve made almost no progress at all into pushing it out.

$A[What?] 

You can barely lift your head in your bound position, but you see the man looking at you with insatiable hunger, his lips stretching in a wide smile.

There is something wrong, but you can&#39;t tell what exactly. He keeps caressing your wet slit and slips a finger inside of you, slowly sipping his wine.

You can&#39;t think, not really, not anymore. His touch feels so good, you just want more, you want him inside of you, right now.

He finishes the last drops from his glass and puts on the night stand.

$L[&#39;Time for the main event, my dear!&#39;]

Finally he penetrates you, sending an immediate wave of pleasure through your body. His long slow thrust feel incredibly good, edging you closer to an oblivious bliss. 

A part of your mind starts panicking when his smile stretches wider, long canine teeth stretching outwards from its edges.

He shoves it all the way in, collapsing on top of you.

$A[Yes!! oh my gawd yes, yes, YES!! Deeper!!]

His teeth sink into the side of your neck, puncturing your artery.
Your head spins.

He starts sucking. There is no pain.

The thrusts continue, filling your aching pussy over and over again. Your body twitches as you feel yourself grow weaker.

He fucks you harder and faster. Indiscernible screams escape your mouth.
The crescendo comes, one last final stroke that plunges into your depths and stays there, his seed spilling into your womb as his teeth drain the life out of your neck. You twitch again, your flower clenching tightly around him into one last, powerful orgasm, before everything fades into darkness.

She is, undeniably, not human. Her ears, her real ears, are on top of her head, like some perverted japanese fantasy, complemented by a long and fluffy tail that she wiggles behind her. 

She is, however, not the definition of cute one would expect from an anthropomorphic feline. Your eyes are drawn to her facial features - cold, enigmatic and vicious, with a carnivorous smile filled with sharp fangs. Her fingers end with long, curved claws that she moves with an agile elegance which leaves no doubt she could rend you to pieces in seconds, if she wanted to.

The pain lasts only for an instant, followed by a wave of warm pleasure that further relaxes all of your muscles. Her hand slides down into your crotch, finding its way under your layers of garments and on the brink of your entrance.

$E[&#39;What a good girl Mihai has chosen. I will train you to serve me well, my dear.&#39;]

You moan softly, growing wetter at her touch. The black woman has an intoxicating presence, pushing all of the right buttons and drawing you into a web of submission...

$E[&#39;My dear, how many children do you want to have? I hear humans typically have only one or two, but you could have an entire legion...&#39;]

Something in her last words sends a chill down your spine and you abruptly snap out of it.

$a[&#39;I-errr-- really should be going now....&#39;]

You make up a few chores to excuse yourself and awkwardly head for the door.

Feeling a little overwhelmed, you head away from the village center, past the few rows of stone houses and into the nearby trees.

The forest is not very dense here and you can still see the village rooftops through the branches. Unlike the deeper parts of the forest, the sparse trees here let through enough sunshine for grass to grow. The weather is just perfect and you take a moment to stroll through the greenery, before sitting on a soft mossy patch under a pine tree.

$A[Most of my body feels kinda the same.... and yet different.]

The $suit that you got from Felicia is a nice reminder of your past self, but now that you really think about it, you start to wonder how it would feel to wear actual feminine clothing, perhaps something simple and light...

You touch your face like a child, discovering a new toy for the first time. Your lips definitely feel fuller and softer. Your features haven&#39;t changed drastically, but at the same time you are a new person, quite literally...

You try to organize things in your head. It&#39;s quite bewildering when you think about it. The observable state of reality contradicts everything that you thought you knew about the world.

$A[There is still so much that people don&#39;t know, isn&#39;t there?]

After meeting these strange characters, going through changes yourself and even seeing time rewind, you are starting to question the concepts of science and rationality that have guided you through life so far. 

Perhaps the only way to truly understand the events around you is to embrace the occult and try to play by their rules? But then again, some part of you still believes that there has to be a rational explanation for everything. Even if magic is real, it should obey a similar set of rules as science...

The more you think about it, the more obvious it seems. All those stories you read as a kid, the superstitions, your grandma&#39;s tales. The signs has always been there.

The world is a dark, twisted place, and man is floating on a lifevest of logic on top of an ocean of insanity. When forces beyond your control pulled you below, it&#39;s finally time to sink or swim.

You are in a most peculiar situation. Few people get to recall their demise. The images pop in your head...

Your limp body being dragged down the dark hallway... razor sharp legs spinning silky dreams... the tightness, the constriction, and the horror that followed...

You feel a droplet of cold sweat run down your spine. The experience is still fresh in your mind. It was somehow more traumatic than usual, the nightmarish appearance of the spider etched deep into your mind. You thankfully lost consciousness early enough not to feel whatever the creature did to your body, but the thought of it is enough to make your heart race.

You take a deep breath and...

You shudder with revulsion, and yet a warm wet spot has quietly formed on your panties. ]

$Mi[&#39;Yes, Miss Alexandra?&#39;]

You take a moment to consider your next words. This place is strange, and its inhabitants are even stranger. But perhaps it would not be wise to be so blunt with your host.

$a[&#39;I was just wondering about your hotel. The architecture doesn&#39;t seem modern, it must have been built by your ancestors. I am very interested in history, so was wondering if you can tell me a bit about that.&#39;]

$Mi[&#39;I see.&#39;] Mihai observes you for a moment, tapping his fingers on the top of his golden cane. $Mi[&#39;I admire your interest. Indeed, The Crooked Elm has stood here for more than 400 years. It was first built by my fa-, I mean great-great-great-grandfather Vasil Petrescu, when our family first moved to these lands. The local folk were initially hostile to him, which is why he made his manor a place of hospitality, in order to welcome all under his wing.&#39;]

$a[&#39;He must have been a great man.&#39;]

$a[&#39;I heard the villagers mention some rumors...&#39;]

Mihai raises an eyebrow inquisitively, but doesn&#39;t respond. It&#39;s clear that getting information out of him regarding the supernatural will not be easy. $A[Perhaps he doesn&#39;t trust me yet?]

You cough lightly, clearing your throat.

$a[&#39;I was just wondering if you&#39;ve noticed anything out of the ordinary.&#39;]

You feel like it&#39;s been an eternity since the last time Mihai blinked.

$Mi[I think you are looking at things from the wrong angle, young miss. There is no such thing as *ordinary*. Everything is a matter of perspective. What is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly.&#39;] He makes a meaningful pause. $Mi[&#39;My advice to you is - don&#39;t be the fly. By the time you realise you&#39;ve been caught in a web, it will be too late.&#39;]

Your eyes lock and for a moment you feel the urge to tell him, but ultimately decide against it. $A[It may be too late for the fly, but not for me, old man...]

You take the stairs up, climbing an increasingly narrow passage that culminates with at a small square platform with no doors.

It&#39;s pretty dark and at first it seems like a dead end, but then you notice there&#39;s ladder propped on your right. Your eyes trace it up to the ceiling, where you make out a rectangular shape.

$A[Is that a trap door...?]

You grab the ladder and climb up, pushing the trap door open with one hand.

A puff of dust raises as you peak your head into the space above.

$A[Wait, is this...?]

You can&#39;t see very well from here, but the place looks familiar. You&#39;ll need to take a closer look.

Taking the flight of stairs down, you emerge in a second hallway. Now that you are not drunk, you can take the time to properly look around.

Unlike the floor above, here the metallic valves and copper wires are few and far between, instead giving way to ornate chandeliers and a thick carpet.

$A[I can definitely see why he calls it a &quot;lair&quot;...]

You walk in a thick silence, your footsteps completely absorbed by the red carpet. You see a door on the right, which you recognise. It&#39;s purple with a golden handle. It&#39;s Lavius&#39; room. 

Farther down the hall there is also another door, which is black with a silver handle. After it you can see another flight of stairs leading further down.

The forest is not very dense here and you can still see the village rooftops through the branches.

After meeting these strange characters, going through changes yourself and even seeing time rewind, you are starting to question the concepts of science and rationality that have guided you through life so far. 

Perhaps the only way to truly understand the events around you is to embrace the occult and try to play by their rules?

Your vision blurs for a moment, then comes into focus again. You turn your head and face an eerie floating figure.

The figure is too distorted to make out anything more than a vague human outline. It lingers for a few moments, then slowly turns around and starts moving down the hallway.

You walk behind the figure which slowly hovers down the hallway, passing several rooms. It halts in front of an empty section of the wall.

Now that you think about it, by all logic of the layout of the hotel, there should be a door there. But all there is is an empty wall... and a shield hanging on top of it.

The shiled is a large ornamental one, probably never made for real battle. You can see intricate scenes hammered into the surface, with warriors and creatures engaged in eternal fight.

The apparition raises a hand, pointing to a part of the ornamentation. Then it hovers forwards, disappearing through the wall. 

$A[It seems that it&#39;s trying to tell me something...]

You examine the $in[metal figures] carefully. When you move your fingers along the surface, part of the scene presses down, sinking into the shield.

The place is dark and small, with dusty stale air and a faint smell of decay.

You use your phone to illuminate the secret room. The apparition seems to be gone, but a quick glance reveals that this is a sort of storage room.

There is a small desk with a chair, surrounded by multiple chests on the ground. The walls are lined will shelves that are stacked with old parchments.

Continuing your investigation, you manage to distinguish a few things:

Right in front of the desk, there is a $in[pile of parchments that have some sort of sketches] on them, which are either maps, blueprints or something of the sort.

On a small shelf to the right there is a $in[stack of letters]. You can notice that they were sealed with wax seals, which are now broken.

In a shelf to the left you can see a $in[giant tome with ornate covers]. The thing is almost as large as the desk itself and looks incredibly rare and expensive.

It seems to be a construction plan for a building. It doesn&#39;t take you long to realize that it&#39;s for The Crooked Elm.

$A[It doesn&#39;t look quite right though...]

While some parts of the building match the current appearance, you can see more floors than there currently are, as well as what appear to be tunnels going underground.

$A[Perhaps those were the original plans, and then they scaled down?]

You&#39;re not sure. You do notice a few interesting things about it though and you try to memorize them. If those tunnels really exist, the information would be valuable to someone.

It&#39;s written with meticulous, perfect handwriting in a gothic font. The golden ink gives off a faint fragrance that you can&#39;t quite identify. 

You flip through the pages of the letter.

Indeed, he looks like a man that has been through hell and back. His pale, stony skin bears many scars and deformities. His body is twisted at an unnatural angle and while his suit covers him well, you are certain that his chest and arms also bear many unnatural marks.

You reach out an place a hand on Ionut&#39;s face. The texture is rough and the skin is hardened by the scar tissue.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/ionut_3.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
Ionut doesn&#39;t flinch nor does he reciprocate your touch.

$a[&#39;How did you get this one, Ionut?&#39;] you trace a finger down a line on his cheek.

$Io[&#39;It vas long ago... bear attack, I vink.&#39;]

$a[&#39;A bear!? You&#39;re lucky you survived!&#39;]

You continue to stare at the servant&#39;s deformed face. By all conventional standards, Ionut is ugly, even hideous. But you find a strange attraction in his ugliness, a sensation deep within that you can&#39;t quite describe.

You will need some time to digest this. You draw your hand away from his face. 

$a[&#39;Thank you, Ionut. I&#39;ll see you later.&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Goodvie, Miss Alexandra.&#39;]

You leap forward, shoving the girl back. The chains snap from hook, rattling as she rolls away to the corner of the room.

Your moment of victory is brief, as the black tendrils are now curling up your legs. You struggle to break free, but their grip is too tight. Then the pentagram on the floor closes again and a lid falls over the world.

No voice comes out of your mouth. 

The tendrils are sliding up your body and now they have your hands. You are pinned to the floor, unable to move.

Your legs are spread apart and you can feel a dark, slimy touch creeping between them. Your heart is pounding like hammers in your chest.

Just when the panic grips you, you see that the girl in the corner has managed to somehow get out of her chains and is now up.

She takes a few wobbly steps then seems to regain her balance. Her head turns towards you and you give her a hopeful nod.

Your moment of anger is short lived however. The dark mass wraps tightly and painfully around your flesh, constricting your body.

One of the tentacles finally makes its way under your $suit and into your panties. It&#39;s slimy end rubs along your slit and presses against your asshole, mounting the pressure. It&#39;s only a matter of moments before your o-ring gives in and opens up, letting the intruder slide in.

And continue sliding in.

The tentacle keeps moving forward. It&#39;s thin and flexible, with a texture that reminds you of a snail&#39;s trail. The continuous sensation of pushing in is maddening. You grit your teeth and roll your eyes, waiting for it to finally stop.

As your stomach begins to bulge, you struggle helplessly to stop the intrusion. A light headedness is starting to grip you and your vision begins to blur. The slimy tentacle is still sliding on and on into your ass and you can feel your resistance waning by the second. Your hole relaxes and another tentacle pushes in, stretching it further.

As the intruders push deeper and deeper into your body, you feel your life force drained away. Your vision begins to blur and (link-reveal-goto:&quot;everything goes dark&quot;,&quot;DIE&quot;)[

Elise places a sympathetic hand on your shoulder. $E[&#39;Yes. Tsk, tsk. It&#39;s not easy to be a woman. Even more so a mother. Do you have offspring?&#39;]

You pull back, the thought of it hitting you with an anvil. $A[I couldn&#39;t, could I?! I mean... this whole thing... it&#39;s only temporary, right?!]

Elise circles around the desk and gets behind you, her skinny hands sliding under your arms and cupping your $breasts. $E[&#39;You would look very good all filled up, girl. It&#39;s only natural.&#39;]

She continues to play with your breasts and belly, pulling you back towards her. Her green lips plant a kiss on your neck and you feel her fangs bite down on your skin.

The pain lasts only for an instant, followed by a wave of warm pleasure that further relaxes all of your muscles. Her hand slides down into your crotch, finding its way under your layers of garments and on the brink of your entrance.

$E[&#39;What a good girl Mihai has chosen. I will train you to serve me well, my dear.&#39;]

You moan softly, growing wetter at her touch. The black woman has an intoxicating presence, pushing all of the right buttons and drawing you into a web of submission...

$E[&#39;My dear, how many children do you want to have? I hear humans typically have only one or two, but you could have an entire legion...&#39;]

Something in her last words sends a chill down your spine and you abruptly snap out of it.

You sit on the desk and start going through the cabinets and drawers, taking out anything of interest. Soon you are looking at a pile of parchments, a handful of letters in envelopes and what appears to be a sketchbook.

As you flip through the stack, a sketch catches your eye - it has a pentagram and a number of runes around it. Just below, there are several notes:

$sys[Summoning steps:

1. Draw the pentagram to scale.

2. Light the candles.

A handful of titles from the shelves catch your eye, so you grab one of them and take a moment to flip through the pages.

The tome is dedicated to (either:&quot;protection spells&quot;,&quot;the history of arcane symbols&quot;,&quot;rune magic&quot;) and you quickly get lost in the intricate diagrams and explanations.

After a good moment of reading, you finally put the book down. (if: (history:) contains &quot;spell occult&quot;)[There isn&#39;t anything that is directly related to the girl in the other room and the symbols around her, it was probably worth the read anyways.]

You have delved deep enough into the mystic arts to handle something like this. To safely cancel a summoning, you need to perform the original ritual in reverse, but contain it within a septagram to avoid any complications.

You take the chalk and draw a large septagram as best as you can. $A[Fire is fueling this, so next are the candles!]

You start blowing out the candles one by one. Their flames flicker angrily, each one harder to stifle out then the previous one.

The last candle fights back viciously, it&#39;s flame raising up again and again despite your attempts to blow it out. Finally you spit on your fingers and pinch the wick, suffocating the flame for good.

$A[That should do it!]

The candles are now all out and you can notice a change in the behaviour of the tendrils. They seem a little more erratic and twitchy, compared to their smooth and elegant pace before. The only thing left is to break the pentagram.

You step on the edge of the pentagram and start smudging the circle with your shoe.

You see the tendrils begin to flail in the air, slowly retracting back into the floor. The symbols on the floor flair up for a few seconds, then the world returns to normal. The distant whispering is gone. The spell has been broken.

Messing with magic can be dangerous, and looking at the woman&#39;s expression, she doesn&#39;t seem to terribly mind her predicament.

The girl is looking at you with a calmly curiosity that surprises you for someone that has just been rescued from infernal torture.

You dodge her gaze and your eyes fall naturally on her breasts. Big, round and full, they are the most perfect breasts you have ever seen. Her pierced nipples look like the crystallization of every man&#39;s fantasies.

There is nothing more you can do, but you remain in place, observing the dance macabre of the slithering mass of tentacles as it forces itself deeper and deeper into the bound girl, inflating her belly and stretching her entrances.

Watching the horrifying scene makes you inexplicably aroused and you slip a hand between your legs, rubbing your slit.

The guilt is intense, but you can&#39;t stop. A big, black tentacle wraps around the girl&#39;s torso and neck, squeezing and suffocating her. Her screams are interrupted by gasps for air, all the while her hips continue to be violated by the otherworldly tendrils.

The candles are burning bright and your own breath is quickening with the pace of your fingers. The tentacle around her throat contracts and you feel the flailing of her body, all while another thick and slimy one is pushing its way into her ass.

You close your eyes for a second, your fingers rubbing faster and faster. A powerful orgasm washes over you, making your entire body shake and shiver. When you finally open your eyes again, the girl&#39;s limp body has stopped all resistance, hanging like a lifless doll from the ceiling while the tentacles continue to ravage her.

$S[&#39;Speak up, sis, it&#39;s only normal.&#39;] She leans in and lifts your chin up with a finger, gazing into your eyes. $S[&#39;Tell me. What. Do you. *WANT?*&#39;]

$a[&#39;I want to submit,&#39;] you whisper.

$S[&#39;Goood. Good girl. I can teach you that. Come over here!&#39;]

She makes a few paces forward, then taps the crop on a spot in front of her.

You gulp, looking at the vampire&#39;s pale curves. She seems so perfectly comfortable having her naked breasts hanging in front of you. You find yourself a little jealous of her confidence.

$S[&#39;Did you bite your tongue, sis?&#39;] she smirks at you, though you can tell it&#39;s meant to be playful rather than mean.

$a[&#39;No, it&#39;s just... this is going to sound **so** stupid...&#39;]

$S[&#39;It&#39;s alright, you know. You can spill the beans - I won&#39;t judge you.&#39;]

You blush and mumble something. $S[&#39;Speak up, girl! I can&#39;t hear you.&#39;] Her finger lifts your chin up and you gaze into her mezmerizing violet eyes.

$S[&#39;I understand, Alex.&#39;] Sabrina&#39;s voice sounds warm and compassionate. $S[&#39;Let&#39;s talk about it. What is it about being a girl that worries you?&#39;]

You get to where she is standing, standing in the designated spot.

Sabrina raises an eyebrow. $S[&#39;I see that we have some work to do. Down, girl!&#39;] 

She hits you behind the knees with her crop, making you fall on the floor.

$S[&#39;As a submissive, first you need to be in the proper position. You must always be below your dom, sitting or lying, to show your subservience. Do it!&#39; ]

Her voice rings like steel, so you quickly get on your knees, bowing your head down.

She circles you, gently touching your arms and shoulders with the leather strap on her crop.

$S[&#39;Submission is about letting your dom do what they want to you. Remember this well.&#39;]

She walks back to her bed. You can&#39;t see her but you stay in your position, not turning around or moving in any way. You can hear her pull out a drawer and the rattling of some objects as she rummages through its contents. When she returns, she is carrying a large elliptical object.

You retain your current position, sliding the dildo underneath you. She observes you carefully as you gently lower your hips on top of it.

The head presses against your slit, which is already surprisingly wet. You lower yourself some more, feeling it slide inside of you.

A small moan escapes your lips. You look up to Sabrina, who has a stern look.

$S[&#39;Do you think I can see anything like this?&#39;] 

Her disappointment feels like a whip.

$a[&#39;I thought I shouldn&#39;t move unless ordered...&#39;]

$S[&#39;A good submissive should be obedient, not mindless. You are a person, not an object. You should seek ways to please your master and to submit even more before them. Now roll over and show me!&#39;]

You fall on your back, spreading your legs to allow her to see as you thrust the dildo inside of you. The heat in your belly is growing with every motion and being exposed is only stoking the fire.

$S[&#39;You have so much yet to learn, sis. A good submissive should not cum without permission.&#39;]

Her command is the sweetest of sins. You shove the dildo deep inside of you, your body tightening around the shaft. The fire flares and you are pushed over the edge into a sea of bliss.

You spread your legs wide, letting her see everything, all the way. In your excitement, a spray of liquid shoots out as you climax.

You shove the dildo deep inside of you, your body tightening around the shaft. The fire flares and you get closer and closer to the edge.

You look at Sabrina, who is observing you silently. From deep within your mind, you know what you have to do.

You make another few fast thrusts and then, when you are right on the edge, you stop.

The desire to continue is overwhelming, but somehow you resist it.

Slowly, you take the dildo out and place it at Sabrina&#39;s feet.

Your gaping pussy is leaking juices, screaming to be filled, wailing for attention, demanding that you finish the job.

You gently kiss her feet and bow your head.

$S[&#39;Magnificent.&#39;]

Her verdict is final and she doesn&#39;t say anything more. She lets you stay at her feet for a while, then leans down, extending a hand.

You blush and trail off, clutching your hands. $A[Why is it so hard to talk about this?]

$S[&#39;Speak up, don&#39;t be shy. Werewolves are a legend among lovers, there is nothing like a night of passion under the full moon. It&#39;s like walking a razor&#39;s edge, you never know if they won&#39;t snap and tear you to pieces... but that&#39;s what makes your heart pump and your slit moisten like never before. Us girls - we live for the thrill, the danger. If a sis tells you she&#39;s not getting hot from bad boys, she&#39;s lying.&#39;] 

Sabrina&#39;s nonchalant approach to the subject matter alleviates some of your nervousness. It&#39;s clear that she&#39;s not one to shy away from sharing what brings her pleasure.

$a[&#39;When I first met him, he killed me.&#39;] you say quietly. $a[&#39;The next time he killed me again. But then we I got these pheromones...&#39;]

$S[&#39;Smart girl! Werewolves have pretty much two modes - fuck or devour. It&#39;s pretty much like men, when you think about it.&#39;] she shrugs to the world in general.

You shrug and follow the servant, giving in to curiosity.

The two of you walk outside, following the path around the manor. The sky is going dark and you strain to make out the line of the path before you.

$a[&#39;What kind of gardening are you doing, Ionut?&#39;]

Judging by the dying vegetation around The Crooked Elm, you doubt the servant does a lot of maintenance.

$Io[&#39;Fishing for worms, Miss Alexandra.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Worms for fishing, you mean? You want to gather earthworms for bait?&#39;]

The light rain sprinkles your face with a refreshing coldness. In another time, you would have enjoyed the cool summer evening in the mountains, perhaps drinking beer under a pine. Your human life seems distant now, but some memories remain. Now you are following the strange servant in the falling dusk, heading to who knows where with a pair of shovels.

The two of you reach the cemetery gates at the end of the garden. Ionut takes out his $in[keychain] and unlocks the padlock, pushing the gates open.

(if: (history:) contains &quot;fence&quot;)[$A[I remember coming here before, but I couldn&#39;t find a way through!]](else:)[$A[I&#39;ve never been here before... there seems to be so much about this place to explore.]]

Beyond the gate you follow the servant down a stony path that leads into the cemetery. Ancient tombstones line on both sides, their engravings faded and illegible. 

$a[&#39;I have to be at the reception soon, Ionut...&#39;] you remind him with a weary voice. The rain is starting to pick up and the cemetery is dark and foreboding. 

$Io[&#39;Ve are alvost there.&#39;]

The servant takes a turn from the main path towards a patch of ground that looks freshly dug.

$S[&#39;I don&#39;t have a werewolf in the closet unfortunately, but we&#39;ll go with the second best thing.&#39;]

She draws a complex symbol on the floor, lights the candles and starts to chant some sort of incantation. The candlelight flickers on her lusty curves in tune with the vibrations of her voice, which becomes hollow and other worldly.

The hairs on the back of your neck begin to stand up and you are gripped with a terrible premonition.

The room suddenly grows darker, as if light itself runs to hide. The candles flicker. Sabrina&#39;s voice us an unrecognizable cacophony of unfathomable sounds. You know that something bad is going to happen. 

$A[&#39;What&#39;s going on?! This was a mistake!&#39;]

You try to run, but your body is frozen in place. The sense of impending doom grows stronger, the symbols on the floor glow and burn away the fabric of reality, opening a blackness that your eyes simply can&#39;t pierce, like nothingness itself.

A creature leaps through the portal. Your breath cuts short as the skull stares at you, the empty sockets emanating a ghoulish red glow. It has the body of a massive canine, with black fur and a short, skeletal tail.

$a[&#39;W-what is this, Sabrina?&#39;] you stutter, cold sweat dripping down your back.

The creature exits the summoning circle, slowly examining the room with its hollow eyes.

$S[&#39;This is Gwyllgi. He is an Omen of Death,&#39;] explains Sabrina, back to her normal voice.

$a[&#39;Why did you summon an Omen of Death, Sabrina?&#39;]

She looks at you with a mischievous glee in her eye. $S[&#39;When you meet a werewolf under the full moon sis, any wrong turn can mean a gory end. Luckily, you have a succubus bracelet, so I thought we could play with the real deal.&#39;]

Gwyllgi slowly paces closer towards you, his two glowing sockers promising your doom.

You swallow hard. $a[&#39;What do I do?&#39;]

$S[&#39;A beast is a beast sis, no matter if it&#39;s a common mutt or a spectral hyperconcept. First, you must let it sniff you.&#39;]

Sabrina didn&#39;t specify what exactly you&#39;re supposed to let it sniff, so you carefully extend a shaking hand towards the thing.

An other-worldly growl shakes the air.

$S[&#39;Get back before it bites it off!&#39;] scowls you Sabrina. $S[&#39;Are you stupid? This isn&#39;t your house pet, you can&#39;t touch it without permissions. Spread your legs and let it sniff you!&#39;]

You stare death in its growing red sockets and slowly spread your legs apart, leaning back so your head and arms are as far away as possible.

The growl quiets down and the giant black dog accepts your invitation, thrusting its skeletal head in your crotch.

You wince back, the sense of impending doom still strong. Strangely enough there is some kind of breath coming from its nose. The bony jaws open and a black, slimy tongue gives you a lick.

$S[&#39;Remember this well. Beast&#39;s first instinct is to fight or fuck, so you must be quick to establish yourself as a female and potential breeding partner.&#39;]

$S[&#39;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re hardly compatible! But it doesn&#39;t know that, of course.&#39;]

Your get down on all fours on the cold stones of the room, taking the familiar doggy style position.

Gwyllgi&#39;s aura of doom grows stronger. You are certain that he&#39;s right behind you, his spectral breath touching the skin of your thighs.

$A[I am not food, I am not food, I am not food...!]

The black dog jumps to hump you, but the angle seems to cause some difficulty. An annoyed growl comes from the bony jaws.

$S[&#39;Head down, ass up, sis!&#39;]

You obey the command, lowering your torso down and arching your ass for easy access. Finally the sense of doom draws back and the creature steadies on you, grasping your thighs with its front paws.

$S[&#39;Well done! It seems that you&#39;ll live to fuck another day, sis.&#39;]

The dog enters you with a powerful thrust, then quickly picks up the pace. The fear is gradually replaced with pleasure and desire as you settle in a familiar role.

He looks to be in poor shape - his clothes, clearly too big for him, are rumpled and dirty as if he&#39;d recently had a brawl in the mud with someone. Then the odor hits you - a strong, rich smell that invades the space around him, a smell of sweat and musk with a tinge of something feral behind it. $A[Wow... eh.. damn] It&#39;s not an entirely unpleasant smell either and you have to admit that concentrating on it does weird things to your head.

He takes off his hood, exposing his face - rough, unshaven, dark sunken eyes looking at you with an impenetrable stare. There&#39;s something weird about this face though, something familiar that you can&#39;t quite put your finger on.

With the windows sealed off and all the candles out, the dining hall is in pitch black darkness. You make a few steps forward and hit your toe on the foot of a table. 

$a[&#39;Ouch!! Damn it. Let me just...&#39;]

You make your way through the blackness, cussing and complaining, until you reach one of the boarded windows, peeling off the blockage. A ray of moonlight penetrates the room, illuminating the chairs and tables and falling on the guest&#39;s terrified face.

$W[&#39;NOOOOORRGHHHHH!&#39;]

The man convulses, clenching his stomach with both hands, his expressions contorting in agony.

The evening is progressing and you begin to wonder what happened to the guest. Since you &quot;met&quot; him on the way to The Crooked Elm, you are surprised that he hasn&#39;t show up yet.

Finally, there is a sharp knock on the door. It creaks open and the tattered figure steps in, smelling of musk and sweat. You swallow hard, trying to act casual and avoid his gaze.

He approaches the desk, then stops. He sniffs the air loudly, once, twice, then narrows his eyes on you.

$W[&#39;You. I remember **you**, girl. Mihai didn&#39;t mention that one of ours was working at the hotel.&#39;] 

You bite your lip. You were hoping that he wouldn&#39;t remember your little encounter in the forest.

$a[&#39;He, uhm, he hired me just a few days ago...&#39;]

Gwyllgi feels different than the werewolf(if: $howl is 1)[ or the wolves in the forest]. You can&#39;t quite put it into words, but instead of the raw bestial passion, there is a cold intelligence, almost a sort of arrogance in his movements.

You follow the instruction and bury your lips between her legs.

You&#39;ve never gone down on a woman before and you&#39;re not quite sure what to expect, but it&#39;s pleasantly surprising. Sabrina has a delicate, bittersweet taste, like red wine and strawberries.

$S[&#39;That&#39;s the way, sis. Make sure you put in a good effort, or you&#39;ll find that I can summon things worse than Gwyllgi to use you at their whim.&#39;]

Her playful threat makes you shiver in anticipation, but you don&#39;t have the willpower not to obey her. You give your best to pleasure her, following the directions of her hand on the back of your head.

While you&#39;re working the demonic dog keeps going at you, the force and pace of its thrusts quickening. Your initial terror from the creature is completely dissolved and now you feel an eagerness burning in your belly.

$S[&#39;Looks like our friend is almost done! Take it like a good girl now,&#39;] says Sabrina, stroking your hair.

You feel something swell up inside of you, lodging in place. As the beast begins to spurt inside of you, you feel a strange comfort that your face is hidden. For some reason being used by the beast is driving you crazy and you don&#39;t want the world to see you like that.

$S[&#39;There, there, it&#39;s alright, sis,&#39;] comforts you Sabrina, as if reading your thoughts. $S[&#39;Take it all in. There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of.&#39;]

You&#39;d like to hurry things up, so you give Ionut a hand with the shoveling. The wet soil is easy enough to work with and soon you have a hole that is almost a few feet deep.

Satisfied with the result, Ionut puts his shovel aside and produces what looks like a fishing string with a hook on the end. He then takes a severed finger out of his pocket, forces it on the hook and lowers the hook into the hole.

You rub your eyes. The scene feels surreal.

After a few seconds there is a slimy, slithering noise coming from the hole and you see the string vibrating. Ionut pulls it out, along with a black wiggling mass wrapped around the end.

$Io[&#39;Pass the bucket,&#39;] he asks, gesturing to an old rusty bucket that you&#39;re just noticing. 

You hand it to him and he shakes the black mass over it, letting the worms fall inside.

You pinch yourself just to make sure that you&#39;re not dreaming. Your mouth opens to ask about the corpses, then closes again, like a fish on land.

$Io[&#39;Very good ingredient, very useful.&#39;] He nods his head towards the hole. $Io[&#39;Mihai collects them.&#39;]

Up close you can see that the worms are long and thick, with pitch-black slimy bodies.

$A[What the hell are those...]

You swing the string towards the bucket, but your movement is too abrupt and a few worms fall off, splashing directly in your cleavage.

$a[&#39;Eeek!&#39;]

You shriek and try to shake them off, but they wiggle down between your breasts and under your clothes.

You feel an adrenaline rush with a mixture of revulsion and morbid curiosity. There&#39;s no way to pull them out one by one, you&#39;d need to remove your $suit for that. The only question is whether to do it right now in the rain and front of Ionut, or wait until you&#39;re back at the hotel...

You enter the narrow space of the boutique, submerging into the ocean of trinkets and shadows. The green-eyed woman pops behind the counter as usual, that is to say out of nowhere.

$M[&#39;Ah, my little pet! you look lovely today.&#39;]

You slowly blink at her. $a[&#39;Since when am I...?&#39;]

She laughs at your confused expression. $M[&#39;Relax, I&#39;m just teasing you. Though I have to say that I have eyes and ears everywhere, and I hear whispers that you&#39;ve been having fun in this new body of yours.(if: $bestiality&gt;0)[ I must admit that I don&#39;t get along with doggies myself, but I can&#39;t judge your curiosity.]&#39;]

$M[&#39;I&#39;ve heard that you&#39;ve made a new friend as well, someone willing to teach you toe secrets of womanhood.&#39;]

$M[&#39;Not at all, I&#39;m happy that you&#39;ve been exploring.&#39;] She smiles wider.]

$M[&#39;I&#39;ve Always thought that you had it in you. Which is why I think you are now ready.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Ready? Ready for what?&#39;]

$M[&#39;Why, to settle my debt, of course. Or should I say **your** debt? Come with me.&#39;]

You follow her hesitantly through the narrow gaps between piles of books and trinkets. She takes a series of turns that don&#39;t make sense in Euclidean space, which hardly surprises you at this point. 

You end up in a small... room? alcove? You are not certain. It&#39;s a space that has been cleared from the piles of *stuff*, barely big enough to hold a little table, a chair, a chest and a blanket.

$A[Is this... her place? There isn&#39;t a bed, but that blanket seems pretty comfy, and I&#39;ve never actually seen her *leave* the shop...]

Felicia takes an ornate key from her pocket and opens the chest. There is a sound of her rummaging through it, but you don&#39;t see much over her shoulder.

$M[&#39;Ah, here it is.,&#39;] she turns around, holding a large parchment that she places on the table.

You lean over it. There are a few lengthy paragraphs of tight handwriting, with the signatures at the end. The strange, squiggly characters are not in any language that you can recognize.

Felicia takes a plume and scribbles a few extra lines at the bottom, leaving a blank line for you.

$M[&#39;Just sign there and we&#39;re all set.&#39;]

$a[&#39;So what am I signing exactly?&#39;]

$M[&#39;That you, on your own free will and accord, will settle the debt in my stead.&#39;]

You scratch your head. $a[&#39;And what will I be doing exactly?&#39;]

$M[&#39;I am sure that you will be instructed thoroughly. Rest assured that it&#39;s nothing outside of your ability.&#39;]

The whole thing sounds a bit fishy and you begin to wonder why Felicia is not being forward with you.

$a[&#39;What if I don&#39;t sign it?&#39;]

She gives you a long, measuring look. $M[&#39;You see, girl, you are alive only because of that bracelet I gave you, for free. After that I agreed to even **sell** you an extremely rare and valuable item, that has saved your life, again. I would be disinclined to help you further if you don&#39;t stick to your word.&#39;]

You take the plume and sign the document on the line.

$M[&#39;Splendid!&#39;] She takes the parchment and folds it several times, slipping it into an envelope. $M[&#39;Take this to our mutual acquaintance at the inn. He&#39;ll understand.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Mutual acquaintance?&#39;]

She rolls her eyes. $M[&#39;You know the bastard. Glamorous and arrogant. I won&#39;t speak his name here.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Ah.&#39;]

You nod and take the envelope. $A[This is getting more interesting... I wonder how she got herself into that debt?]

You take the envelope out of your pocket and discretely slip it towards him. Lavius raises an eyebrow, but pulls it towards him nonchalantly, taking the parchment out.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/Lav0.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt; 
He clearly recognizes the document as you see his eyes glance over it straight to the two new lines at the bottom. His eyebrow raises slightly, then his lips curl into a thin smile.

$L[&#39;Miss...?&#39;]

$a[&#39;Alexandra.&#39;]

$L[&#39;Miss Alexandra, I am not sure how you came to be in the position that you are in, but I must warn you that no debt can be forced onto another against their will. You don&#39;t have to do this.&#39;]

You swallow hard, gazing into his glittering eyes. There is something deep and dark in them. But you already know that.

$a[&#39;I have willingly accepted to pay her debt.&#39;]

$L[&#39;I see.&#39;] He takes a sip from the red liquid in his glass. $L[&#39;I must admit that this does not bring me full satisfaction. The terms of this contract were written to reflect the strong, **burning** feelings that I have towards... well I suppose you already know her. It is a shame that I will not be able to deliver to her personally the full extent of our agreement.&#39;]

He taps his fingers on the table, taking another slow sip pensively. $L[&#39;Still, the contract is being honored. I never expected her to find someone else willing, but I won&#39;t stain my pride by breaking the rules. I am a man of honor, Miss Alexandra. I accept your right to clear this debt.&#39;]

$L[&#39;I will not go lightly on you just because you are not *her*.&#39;]

After a few moments his grip lessens and you manage to pull your hand away.

$a[&#39;So, what do I have to do?&#39;]

His thin smile curls again. $L[&#39;Just come with me, it will be easier to show you.&#39;]

You follow him and Lavius shuts the door behind you, curring off the sounds of the inn. The backroom has no windows and is dimly lit by a sole lantern.

$A[See how, **that**&#39;s like, bitch!]

The dark tentacles rise from the ground longer and thicker, wrapping tightly around the woman&#39;s body. 

Whereas before they were just rubbing and teasing, now they push aggressively into her holes, making her body shake helplessly at the intrusion.

Watching her belly expand is hypntozing. The bumps of the tentacles wriggling inside of her create ripples on her skin, her moans rising in a crescendo.

Perhaps the memory of your own demise is still fresh in your mind, or perhaps some long-hidden sadism is awakening in your heart, but the scene feels you with twisted arousal, your pussy growing wet and needy from the girl&#39;s agony.

You watch with morbid curiosity, taking in every detail of the otherworldly spectacle.

Suddenly the girl pulls violently on her chains, shattering them apart. Her voice raises over the eerie noise of the summoning, shouting in a strange language:

The pentagram glows intensely, then the lights begin to fade and the tentacles retract back into the floor, leaving puffs of purple smoke behind.

Breathing heavily, the woman rises to her feet, removing her blindfold. Her eyes narrow on you suspiciously.

As much as it&#39;s satisfying and arousing to watch the tentacles ravage the woman, in the end you decide to be the better person.

Luckily, you are capable to cancecel the spell. To safely interrupt a summoning, you need to perform the original ritual in reverse, but contain it within a septagram to avoid any complications.

You take the chalk and draw a large septagram as best as you can. You erase the symbols that you&#39;ve added, causing the tentacles to calm down. $A[Now, for the candles...]

You start blowing out the candles one by one. Their flames flicker angrily, each one harder to stifle out then the previous one.

The last candle fights back viciously, it&#39;s flame raising up again and again despite your attempts to blow it out. Finally you spit on your fingers and pinch the wick, suffocating the flame for good.

$A[That should do it!]

The candles are now all out and the tendrils become slow and sluggish, releasing the woman from their grip. The only thing left is to break the pentagram.

You step on the edge of the pentagram and start smudging the circle with your shoe.

You see the tendrils begin to flail in the air, slowly retracting back into the floor. The symbols on the floor flair up for a few seconds, then the world returns to normal. The distant whispering is gone. The spell has been broken.

Two radiant, violet eyes slowly blink at you.

$S[&#39;Who are you?&#39;]

The girl is looking at you with a calmly curiosity that surprises you for someone that has just been rescued from infernal torture.

You swallow hard and decide to write the whole thing off as an accident. From what she knows, you saved her. It&#39;s probably best to keep it that way.

You dodge her gaze and your eyes fall naturally on her breasts. Big, round and full, they are the most perfect breasts you have ever seen. Her pierced nipples look like the crystallization of every man&#39;s fantasies.

$S[&#39;Your body? Do you need explanations of female anatomy?&#39;]

$a[&#39;No, it&#39;s not that!&#39;] you laugh nervously. $a[&#39;It&#39;s just... the first time I turned into a woman, I thought that that would be it. There were subtle changes when I used the bracelet again, or at least that&#39;s what I thought, keeping track of reality has not been easy... but now... now I feel like I&#39;m a different person again.&#39;]

You squeeze your tight, $breasts_size breasts, tracing the outline of your body. $a[&#39;That&#39;s not how things were before... so I wonder if you could tell me anything about this?&#39;]

$S[&#39;I see. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re acting so surprised, sis. Your body is in the process of being remade, it&#39;s flexible, *malleable*. I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if eventually you end up with large curvy hips and voluptuous breasts. Most succubae do, and there&#39;s a reason for it.&#39;]

You swallow hard, the image burning in your mind. There is something so tantalizing about picturing yourself as a succubus, your body in perfect form for lust and pleasure...

The moment your hand wraps around it, it bursts into flames, disintegrating into dust, along with the garden around it.

You are left in the dark void again, floating into nothingness.

A warm, tingling sensation wraps your body. Suddenly you feel your legs starting to grow. They stretch slowly, becoming leaner and thinner. Suddenly your thighs aren&#39;t touching anymore and you feel your gap completely exposed.

You give him a nod, flip the sign at the reception and follow him outside.

The two of you followthe path around the manor as the sky darkens to dusk. Ionut quickens the pace, heading towards the far end of the garden.

The two of you reach the cemetery gates at the end of the garden. Ionut takes out his $in[keychain] and unlocks the padlock, pushing the gates open with a creak of the rusty hinges.

The servant takes a turn from the main path towards a patch of ground that looks freshly dug.

$Io[&#39;Now ve ig a little hole.&#39;]

Ionut pushes his shovel into the mud, excavating a sizable chunk of soil. You watch him work, fascinated by the process. You didn&#39;t notice this last time, but there is something deeply ominous about the whole scene.

The wind is howling among the ancient pines in the distance, the ridges of the mountain growing darker by the minute. You can swear that the earth beneath is pulsing, awoken by every scoop of the shovel.

$a[&#39;Are these worms everywhere, Ionut?&#39;] you ask mesmerized.

$Io[&#39;Vat? No, only in cemetery. They come from ze crypt.&#39;] He points a finger to a decrepit stone mass in the distance. $Io[&#39;But don&#39;t go in ze crypt. The vurms  too big. Here vurms small - good for catch.&#39;]

Still keeping your eyes on $I[the crypt], you swear that you can feel a slight pull towards it, like *an appel du vide* from standing at a high ledge, just over the abyss.

Much like last time, Ionut produces a fishing pole and takes a $in[severed finger] out of his pocket, lowering it as bait into the hole.

After a few seconds there is a slimy, slithering noise from the hole and the string vibrates, prompting Ionut to pull it out, along with a black wiggling mass of worms wrapped around the bait.

$Io[&#39;Vould you like to try?&#39;] asks the servant, dropping the gruesome catch into the metal bucket. You take over from him, pinning another severed finger on the hook before proceeding to a dangle the string down into the hole.

$A[How did it I end up doing this...]

Small scarce raindrops continue to soak the cemetery grounds as you fish one wriggling mass after another from the desecrated ground. The slimy creatures are pitch black and almost an elbow long, threatening to make their way out of the iron bucket if it wasn&#39;t for the lures keeping them occupied.

Your small voice sounds unconvincing even to yourself, but nevertheless the servant gives you a nod and heads back to the manor.

You turn around and head down the stony path among the graves. There is something pulling you, an invisible *longing* that beckons you further and further towards the ruins of the crypt.

As you walk the path you have the strange feeling that something is mirroring your movements, something underground sliding along with you. You feel its presence at the back of your mind, innately understood through senses that you can&#39;t describe nor comprehend.

Finally, the crypt is upon you. It&#39;s entrance open like a stone maw, there is no door nor lock to stop you. Just a gaping mouth and stairs down into the darkness.

The rain falls on your skin and slides down your $breasts. The cemetery air feels cool but somehow stale and moldy, with a subtle scent of decay that is now somehow even stronger.

With a morbid delight, you give in to the dark impulse and slowly yet deliberately begin your descent.

There aren&#39;t any torches nor other light to guide you, so each step down brings you closer to total darkness. The tension is building in your belly. A warmth is dripping between your legs.

Somehow you sense life and movement - deep beneath, below the floor, beyond the walls.

With fluttering anticipation, you begin to disrobe your $suit, dropping pieces as you continue your way down the stairs.

Soon, you are walking $A[completely naked]. Your $breasts hang freely in the stale air of the crypt.

Moving deeper down still, the cold stones beneath your feet are replaced with moist soil. It is  soft and tender, letting you sink into it with each step. It reminds you of a freshly turned lawn, right before the first rain.

Suddenly you feel something cold and slimy touch your foot.

You stand frozen, holding your breath. Your heart is pounding like crazy. The slimy thing coils up your leg like a snake, methodically exploring the new territory. Soon it reaches your loins and you feel the tip burrow between your legs, following your dripping juices.

One of them wraps around your wrists, pulling your arms above your head. You fall to your knees, the squirming darkness closing in from all sides.  It feels like the earth all around you is moving, shifting and slithering. Your skin is caressed by a thousand tongues, curling underneath you.

The anticipation is building in your chest with every breath. Time feels like a distant memory in the total darkness of the cavernous space, where all of your sensations are heightened to the extreme.

You can taste the earth on your tongue. You can hear the soil shifting as the creatures tunnel through it. You can smell them too - an intense, saturated smell of death and decay.

After a little more teasing, the creature finally plunges in. It contracts and expands, making its way forward with each convulsion. You feel it making its way deeper and deeper, with grim determination that promises that the worst is yet to come.

Soon you feel it reach a threshold inside of you, something deep in your belly. A gentle pressure begins to build.

The thought comes with an electrifying revelation. That dirty, decaying abomination is trying to break into your most sacred depths, into the core of your womanhood.

$A[Mmm...]

You feel the hard bulge travel along the worm&#39;s body inside your pussy, pushed forward by its contractions. The journey ends when it passes through your cervix and with grim inevitability the egg is squeezed out directly into your womb.

Your head is spinning as the full implications of your situation dawn on you. Other round bulges press against your opening and slip easily inside, your dripping pussy facilitating the process.

You could probably try to escape, but what are your chances? What&#39;s the point. It&#39;s what you came here for.

You decide to hold the pole steady, not getting any of the nasty worms on yourself. But by the time the bucket is full and Ionut is ready to leave, you feel a small disappointment building in you.

$A[Was I expecting something more...?]

It&#39;s almost completely dark now and Ionut is ready to leave. However there&#39;s another, silent voice that&#39;s beckoning your attention towards the ruins of $in[the crypt].

$A[After all, why not...]

You swing the string towards the bucket, but this time right over yourself, splashing a handful of worms directly in your cleavage.

Your body electrifies with goosebumps as  they wiggle down between your breasts and under your clothes. Then comes the adrenaline rush. There is a mixture of revulsion and morbid curiosity. 

$Io[&#39;Are you alright, Miss Alexandra?&#39;]

Ionut looks concerned. You try not to give away too much from your expression.

$A[Ok, Alex, enough play... I will need to get rid of these or I will look absolutely ridiculous. What was I thinking..?]

There&#39;s no way to pull them out one by one, you&#39;d need to remove the your $suit for that. The only question is whether to do it right now in the rain and front of Ionut, or wait until you&#39;re back at the hotel...

Your small voice sounds unconvincing even to yourself, but nevertheless the servant gives you a nod and heads back to the manor.

You wait for him to leave and take a deep breath. You know you should probably remove all those creatures from underneath your clothes... but instead turn around and head down the stony path among the graves. There is something pulling you, an invisible *longing* that beckons you further and further towards the ruins of the crypt.

As you walk the path with the worms crawling around your breasts, it all feels so $A[delightfully wrong]. You have the strange feeling that the worms are enjoying it too. 

Then... there is something else. Something is mirroring your movements, something underground sliding along with you. You feel its presence at the back of your mind, innately understood through senses that you can&#39;t describe nor comprehend.

Felicia returns your wink with a smile.

$M[&#39;You have progressed so much as a woman. I&#39;m proud of you.&#39;]

Her hand lands on your shoulder, a gentle squeeze of her fingers sending a wave of warmth. You hold her gaze, thinking her words over.

You pull yourself up through the trap door and emerge into the space above. 

It&#39;s a room with a wooden floor and old furniture, all covered in a thick layer of dust. Grey light barely sips through the stained windows. You can see a handful of hunting trophies hung above a cozy looking fireplace.

$A[&#39;It&#39;s the hunting cabin!&#39;]

When you think about it, it all makes sense. Lavius&#39; lair was hidden underneath, so naturally there would be some way to connect the two.

Curious, you head to the front door. It&#39;s locked just as you remember, but something draws your attention. The key is hanging from a nail just beside the small window.

$A[&#39;It&#39;s odd that they would leave it just in arm&#39;s reach, but then again it&#39;s not visible from the outside...&#39;]

You give the window a little push and it creaks open just enough for a hand to slide in.

$A[&#39;Well this is convenient!&#39;]

You take the key and unlock the door, leaving it on the nail again. In the future you&#39;ll be able to come and go from the outside, now that you know how to reach for the key.

$a[&#39;Thank you... I- I care about you too. If I make it through all of this, I&#39;d like to see you again.&#39;]

$a[&#39;Don&#39;t stop,&#39;] you whisper softly. The moment is too intoxicating. Time feels like it&#39;s slowed down. You have been waiting for this, waiting for too long.

$a[&#39;I want-&#39;]

Words escape you. These feelings that rush to your heart don&#39;t have names to be spoken. 

$M[&#39;Hush, love. I know.&#39;] She grins at you and you realize that she has been waiting patiently, all along. The cat slides behind you, swift as a shadow, and you feel her warm breath behind your ear.

She reaches around, gently sliding a hand up your throat. You lift your chin up, closing your eyes and sensing every inch, every stroke of her fingers.

$M[&#39;There&#39;s a good girl. You have learned well, tiny human.&#39;]

Her lips touch the skin of your shoulder, sending goosebumps down your back. You hold your breath, getting [[lost in the moment]].

She pulls you closer towards her and you succumb to sensation. You feel her breasts press against the line of your back, her curly hair flowing all around you, the kisses that move from your shoulder and up the side of your neck, ever so slowly, peck by peck.

$a[&#39;Aaah...&#39;]

The hand around your neck tightens ever so slightly, just enough to show you who&#39;s in control.

You are a woman.

You have, in fact, always been a woman.

There are memories in your mind, distant memories, of the time when you were a man. It is so far away now, in another life, another reality. It feels like they are false memories now, something else that happened to someone else.

As you float through the darkness you feel a gentle warmth enveloping you, a feeling that everything is right.

The real question is what can you become?

You realize that you are walking forward, have been for some time. You don&#39;t know where the path leads, but you find yourself excited to walk it.

Figures appear in the void around you and you hear whispering voices with familiar tones. There is a cat, a spider, a wolf and a bat. They are calling for you.

The only thing remaining is someone to take charge of you.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/Lav0.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
$a[&#39;I heard a very interesting rumour... did you know that there is a mermaid here?&#39;]

$L[&#39;A mermaid! How exciting!&#39;]

$a[&#39;I know! To tell you the truth, I&#39;ve always wanted to see a mermaid. In fact, I was hoping you might be able to help me with that...&#39;]

$L[&#39;Oh? What made you turn towards me?&#39;]

You look Lavius up and down - he still seems to be keeping up the innocent act.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/Lav0.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
$L[&#39;You do? How?&#39;]

$a[&#39;A girl has her secrets. But if you show me how to talk to her, perhaps I will tell you...&#39;]

You try not to raise too much suspicion, but you can tell that there is a subtle shift in Lavius&#39; look.

$L[&#39;Very well, my dear, when you put it like this... I suppose there&#39;s no point denying. Guilty as charged, she is a friend.&#39;]

$a[&#39;So you will tell me how I can meet her?&#39;]

$L[&#39;I&#39;ll do you one better. Come.&#39;]

Lavius gets up from the bench and gestures you to follow suit

He lets you go on for a while, visibly enjoying his position of power.

$L[&#39;Well, my dear, when you put it like this... I suppose I could be persuaded to pull some string. Let us go somewhere a bit more private.&#39;]

His hand slides between your legs, gently rubbing the growing wetness. You give him an eager nod and the two of you get up from the bench.

$a[&#39;Where shall we go?&#39;] you ask playfully.

$L[&#39;I know the perfect place. Come.&#39;]

You enter the basement, which has been left unlocked for the day. Earlier you left the box there with Ionut and it hasn&#39;t moved an inch since. Approaching it fills you with slight unease, which you try to shake off.

$A[This can&#39;t be dangerous, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t let me do it alone. But then again...]

You bend down and carefully knock on the top of the box. The sound is deep and hollow, but nothing happens.

The two of you get up from the bench and Lavius takes you around the side of the manor. You recognize the familiar door to the basement.He takes a look around and the two of you sneak in.

$a[&#39;My my, what discretion!&#39;]

$L[&#39;Always! I would hate to spoil the lady&#39;s honor in front of her guests!&#39;] laughs Lavius. 

You laugh back, humoring him. $A[Yeah, I bet he would absolutely **hate** to tarnish my reputation...]

The air in the basement is cool and slightly damp. Despite the time of day, it&#39;s almost dark in here, what little light there is coming from the door to the garden and the handful of torches hanging on the walls.

$a[&#39;So, what can I do for you?&#39;] you ask coyly.

$L[&#39;My my, I see that you&#39;re really eager to see a mermaid indeed! Very well, let&#39;s get her out first.&#39;]

Lavius goes to the box and removes the lid, letting it fall to the side. You weren&#39;t expecting to get straight to that, leaving you slightly confused.

$a[&#39;So what now...?&#39;]

$L[&#39;Now, my dear, we give her a reason to come to the surface.&#39;]

$a[&#39;You want me to...?&#39;]

$L[&#39;Come on, darling, don&#39;t be shy. I can help you if you wish.&#39;] Lavius&#39; hand slides deeper under the fabric of your clothes. 

You&#39;re not sure how serious he&#39;s being about attracting the mermaid, or he&#39;s just looking for a reason to get you naked, but either way it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;ll be able to proceed without indulging him.

From the depths a form begins to take shape. The more you look at it, the brighter and closer it appears, until you see the face of a beautiful young woman, extending a hand towards you.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/join_me0.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
$N[&#39;Hello. Who are you?&#39;] comes a sweet, melodic voice. It&#39;s the most beautiful voice you have ever heard.

$N[&#39;That&#39;s wonderful! I think I&#39;m in love with you too. Would you like to come and join me?&#39;]

The hand reaches closer. You can see the fingers almost touching the surface of the water. You lean in closer, but something stops you.

$L[&#39;Isn&#39;t she the most perfect creature?&#39;] comes a voice from behind.

$a[&#39;She is everything I&#39;ve ever wished for,&#39;] you reply slowly, fixated on the bright blue eyes.

$L[&#39;If you fall in, she will strangle you to death.&#39;]

$A[If I bail on him now what will he think of me...? I&#39;m sure the noises will go away eventually.]

You sneak into the nearby trees and find a good spat that allows you to keep an eye on the cabin while keeping a low profile yourself. If anyone comes, you&#39;ll see them first.

Time moves painfully slow, but eventually the sun&#39;s disc rolls over the high ridges and an early dusk begins to settle over the forest. You know that there is still some time before nightfall, but you&#39;d better not delay your way back to the manor.

Climbing to the second floor, you pause for a moment, looking down the hallway.The door to the black woman&#39;s room is slightly ajar, almost like an invitation.

$E[&#39;The cat - she is a tricky one. Slippery, elusive. Hard to catch. Up to no good.&#39;] Elise paces around. You aren&#39;t usually very good at reading&#39;s spider expressions, but if you had to guess you&#39;d say that she looks agitated. $E[&#39;Tsk, tsk. Tell me, has she mentioned anything to you?

You look at her, trying to appear casual while your mind is racing.

Elise paces around, her eight black legs dancing elegantly as she moves. You suddenly realize that telling her about Felicia might not have been the smartest thing to do.

$A[&#39;If I&#39;m not careful, I could get Felicia into some serious trouble...&#39;]

But Elise has had her own place in your story as well, (if: $Elise_choice is &quot;servant&quot;)[a place that has earned your obedience in her own ways.

The spider&#39;s gaze narrows on you. You sense your wiggle room growing narrower.

The spider&#39;s fangs dart in a flash, and you feel a burning sensation in your neck. The world grows blurry and your body feels weak. You try to run but your limbs fold like spaghetti and you collapse on the floor.

The last thing you remember is being wrapped in something soft and dragged off down the hallway as you slowly [[lose consciousness]].(set: _ti to 8)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1199" name="defend felicia2" tags="" position="3006,7753" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$fl2&lt;/div&gt;

$a[&#39;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s really up to something,&#39;] you offer tentatively. $a[&#39;She didn&#39;t strike me as malicious, or that interested in what&#39;s going on here.

$E[&#39;Tsk. Do you think she hides away in that box of hers just for fun?&#39;]

You try to thread carefully with your next words.

$a[&#39;She isn&#39;t like you, Elise. You are big and strong, and you are cunning... you can take care of anyone that tries to get in your way.&#39;]

Elise seems flattered by your words.

$E[&#39;I guess you are right... when you are something as soft and squishy as a cat, I guess we can be gracious and allow some minor mischief...&#39;]

You seem to have pacified Elise, at least for now.

$E[&#39;Thank you for your thoughts, demon girl. Now I understand why you were able to see me. But perhaps it would be better for everyone if I made a few changes.&#39;]

Your vision tilts and a familiar silvery fog washes over your mind. You blink fast, trying to shake off the wave of confusion. Suddenly, a female silhouette is standing in front of you, her green spectacles reflecting a light that doesn&#39;t exist.

$E[&#39;This is better, isn&#39;t it my dear?&#39;]

You look at the furry creature, trying to determine if it&#39;s trying to make some sort of joke.

$a[&#39;Uhm, thank you...?&#39;]

The cat seems to smirk at you. $M[&#39;Still, freedom comes at a cost. Once you are out of the loop, you will lose the safety that it provides. You cannot go back. Have you learned enough to proceed?&#39;]

Thinking about, you realize that the cat is right. There is still more that you can learn. And knowledge is power. Now that you know how to navigate around danger... it doesn&#39;t hurt to stay a while longer. 

You approach the large window door - it leads on to a balcony. The full moon basks the manor and surrounding forest in a shower of silver rays and the black dead branches creak in the gusts of wind.

Here from the attic, the fall is surprisingly high, you remark as you stand up on the railing. The cobblestones on the ground below are hard and thick. You seem to have made up your mind.

Your descent is quick and silent. Your body breaks on impact, leaving a crimson splash on the black and silver canvas of the night. Darkness (link-reveal-goto:&quot;takes you.&quot;,&quot;DIE&quot;)[

$M[&#39;Your choice, girl.&#39;] The cat gives you a little nod and jumps onto the terrace, disappearing into the night.

You stare into the emptiness of the attic hallway, then shrug and head to your room. It&#39;s been a long and eventful day and now you long for it to be over.

As you place your hand on the door knob, a voice comes over your shoulder:

The room plunges in silver darkness, the silhouettes outlined by the shine of the almost full moon outside. You lie on the hard mattress, thinking about the mysterious events of the day. The bracelet is hanging comfortably around your wrist, its presence somehow comforting against the creaking of the old building and the howling of the wind in the dead branches outside.

$E[&#39;Tsk, tsk. You are a mess, girl...&#39;]

The spider seems to somehow believe your version of events, despite a dose of scepticism in her voice. The giant head cocks to the side, 8 shiny black eyes staring at you unblinkingly. $E[&#39;I do have one more question then, tsk. Have you seen any cats around?&#39;]

You swallow hard. You don&#39;t want to die right now - so close to your goal. With cold sweat running down your spine, you reluctantly tell the creature about the bracelet and your predicament, hoping that the truth will be your best shield.

$E[&#39;I see, tsk tsk. Quite the adventure you&#39;ve had, girl.&#39;] The spider cocks its head to the side, 8 shiny black eyes staring at you unblinkingly. $E[&#39;I do have one more question then, tsk.&#39;]

You slow down your pace, the trill of the moment overcoming your reason.

$A[I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually doing this...]

Under the rising moon you stand on your knees, pleasuring a creature that changes with every minute before your eyes, straying farther and farther from human. You feel the texture morph in your mouth as the member grows and becomes more bestial. It is something that you really shouldn&#39;t be doing, but that thought only drives further the fire in your belly.

A powerful hand lifts up the top of your $suit, nudging you over the line of caution and reason. You pause for a moment and quickly disrobe, indulging into the absurdity of it all. It&#39;s liberating and exhilarating. Naked under the moonlight, guided only by desire.

The creature emits a piercing howl into the night, though you are uncertain if it&#39;s a cry of pleasure or a call from its bestial side. A shiver of excitement washes over you and you place a hand on its leg, feeling the tensing muscles and the thickening fur.

Suddenly another howl answers the call, somewhere close and just behind. A shadow leaps out from the trees and the wolf jumps on top of you, mouth open and drooling with excitement.

You double your efforts, pleasing the creature as if your life depends on it. The thrill makes your heart pump faster and as the werewolf&#39;s powerful hand grasps your hair you feel a pleasant lightheadedness and a warmth in your belly.

In a short while it begins growling and grasps you tighter, a long warm load emptying in your throat. The bracelet glows hot on your wrist as it absorbs the energy. 
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/wwbj2.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

The creature finally pulls its enormous member out of your mouth, giving you room to breathe. The fresh mountain air feels pleasant on your burning body. You look up to the hideous creature with an overt longing in your $eyes. It looks away and runs off into the darkness of the woods, leaving you wet and frustrated.

After a while you get up on your feet and come to your senses. You are alone.

You lower your back in an arch and move your legs apart, allowing the wolf to slip easily inside you.

$A[Aaah...]

There is a feeling of stretching, followed by fullness as he makes his way inside all the way. The front paws of the beast lock over your hips, holding you tightly in place as it begins to pound.

Noticing your distracted moans, the werewolf grabs a fistful of your hair and pulls your face back towards him, demanding attention. You can see that he&#39;s twitching with excitement and ready to burst.

As if under a spell, you lean in and wrap your $lips around the tip, gently kissing it. It feels ready to burst. In a moment of pure lust and insanity, you reach and grab his balls with your hand, squeezing them gently.

The werewolf growls in pleasure and suddenly bursts, overflowing your mouth with sticky white semen that begins to drip down your chin and onto your naked breasts.

As the wolf&#39;s pace accelerates from behind you begin to moan again, smaller squirts splashing over your face. Then the wolf locks in place and you feel him empty his load inside of you.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/double_ww.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

As you slowly come back to your senses you realize that you are all covered in sticky white spots and dirt from the ground. You were wise to remove your clothes after all - cleaning yourself is easier than washing your $suit.

You are still close to the creek that flows by the side of the road, so you decide to take a quick dip in the cool waters. It&#39;s not deep enough to swim, but you can submerge your arms and legs and splash water over your breasts, cleansing most of the fluids.

After a quick air-drying you put your $suit back on, feeling lucky that it&#39;s still a summer night. With the clock ticking, you make haste back to the hotel.

You can hear distant whispering, coming from beyond dreams and reason. Your flesh becomes hotter still and suddenly you realize that you are past the point of no return. 

Pleasure overwhelms you and you come into a climax, shaking into an orgasm as two powerful wings sprout from your back, along with a tail from the base of your spine.

$A[Aaah....]

Your sense of control is slipping. You are now a succubus - it is a fact that you know and understand innately. Your body has changed, but so has your mind. You feel your former logic and reason muffled, pushed down by the necessities of lust and desire.

$R[You must feed. You must be used.]

You are alone in the darkness, your naked body longing to be touched. The desire is so strong it&#39;s physically painful. Your thoughts are being railroaded, every memory, every feeling, every fragment of your being pulled towards a singular purpose.

The pentagram beneath you glows and silhouettes begin to appear from all directions, surrounding you.

(display:&quot;unav&quot;), says a voice to your left. 

(display:&quot;unav&quot;), responds another.

They sound strange, yet familiar. Are there people you&#39;ve met ? Strangers, lovers, friends?

You try to look around and see who they are, but the chain on your collar is pulled down, bending your head to the floor.

$A[That&#39;s right... it doesn&#39;t matter who they are. Doesn&#39;t matter if I know them. Complete strangers or past lovers... friends or mortal enemies...]

You spread your legs obediently, waiting to fulfil your purpose. A succubus needs sustenance. Choice is no longer a matter.

The first one gets a hold of your hips and begins to pound you quick and fast, his movements as frenzied as the burning thoughts in your head. As you feel the semen burst inside of you there is an immediate feeling of bliss and satisfaction that leaves your eyes rolling while you moan in ecstasy.

As the next one comes you let your head rest on the floor, the red glow of the pentagram filling your vision as your body is taken over and over by whoever pleases. A thin line of drool flows from your lips and onto the scarlet runes. All thoughts give way to pure, [[hedonistic pleasure]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1241" name="hedonistic pleasure" tags="" position="8814,95" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$dark&lt;/div&gt;

The night is filled with lust and darkness.

As you sleep, shameless moans escape your lips. Like frozen cherries, they are sweet and red and so ripe and ready for every kiss you dream of. Your breasts, soft and pale, with hard nipples waiting to be pinched and bitten.

You dream of demons and chains, of being taken by monsters and men as your hands clench the sheets of your bed. In your visions you are a succubus, cursed to be forever a slave of your carnal desires.

You make a step forward into the light of the full moon, letting the glow reflect off of your naked skin. 

Up close, the wolf-man is much larger than you, his body continuing to morph and grow under your gaze. He pushes you down on the grass and leaps on top, his weight pressing you down in place as his immense member slides inside of you, stretching your body to its limit.

$W[&#39;Aaaarghoooooooouulll!!&#39;]

His cry turns into a howl, piercing the night. As he loses his last features of humanity, his movements become even more primal and uninhibited, his powerful muscles treating your body as a rag doll.

Suddenly his jaws sink into your left arm and bite it clean off, devouring the whole of it with a few fast crunching sounds. There is no pain, only surprise and some weird mesmerism of the situation. As he bites into your second arm you feel as if time goes in slow motion, the crimson droplets of blood hanging in the air before falling on your naked back.

Taken by hunger, the beast snaps your legs as well, one after the other, like a tiny snack in his gargantuan belly. You are left lying with 4 stumps, with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Returning to its sexual appetites, the creature humps your now quadriplegic body, relieving the rest of its desires and leaving you to lie in a pool of blood and semen, white and crimson shining equally bright under the full moon.

$E[&#39;There&#39;s a good girl,&#39;] she chuckles, tracing a hand on your skin. Her nails feel hard and sharp, leaving small marks along your $breasts.

Her ~~multiple~~ arms descend all around you, enveloping your body in caresses. Her large, round abdomen lowers down, positioning in front of your opening. *Something* extends further, pushing into you as the ~~creature~~ woman continues to caress you.

$a[&#39;Aahh!&#39;] You give a soft moan, sensing it sink deeper.

$E[&#39;Hold steady, girl! Just like that, tsk.&#39;]

Your vision blurs and your eyes roll, giving in to sensation and pleasure. Something fills you up, over and over again, so abundant that the pressure inside you grows and stretches your womb. The bracelet glows on your wrist and you feel your **hunger** finally begin to satiate. It is the most incredible and rewarding feeling.

$a[&#39;Please, more...!&#39;]

$E[&#39;Tsk, greedy girl. That&#39;s enough for now...&#39;]

Her voice raises to a resonating command and you obey quickly, dropping your $suit to ground. Elise takes a good look of your $breasts with stiff, aroused nipples. 

$E[&#39;Now, let&#39;s be honest darling - you need this more than I do. So why don&#39;t you ask me **nicely**?&#39;] 

You lock eyes with her and hold her gaze, then swallow hard. Your heart starts racing. There is a part of you that wants to stay in control, but also another - ready to let go, ready to do anything, everything, to satiate the **hunger**.

It takes a moment for your thoughts to start coming together again. After several minutes, eventually you manage to compose yourself.

The haze is dissipating from your mind and you notice that the **hunger** has diminished as well. It&#39;s still there, but definitely not as consuming as before.

$E[&#39;Hope you are fed now, demon. Tsk tsk.&#39;]

You smile shyly and nod at Elise. $a[&#39;Thank you for your, eeer, help.&#39;]

She waves a hand dismissively.

Now fully composed, you fetch your $suit again and get dressed and ready to leave. A final look at the black woman tells you that she&#39;s also had enough of your presence for now.

$E[&#39;A hungry succubus, what a delight, tsk. Very well, girl - undress!&#39;]

$E[&#39;On your knees then.&#39;]

You obey that order as well, letting yourself slip into the comfy routine of following instructions. A light purple haze begins clouding your mind. You look up to the black creature and she looks down, ~~8~~2 black eyes with a green metallic sheen, staring at you with a mix of lust and entertainment.

$E[&#39;Tsk, that will do, girl.&#39;] She grabs you by the hair, pulling your face up to hers. $E[&#39;It&#39;s true that there&#39;s nothing as fun as a succubus in heat, tsk. You&#39;re lucky that I like you, girl. I will nourish your hunger and not use you for... other, purposes. Tsk.&#39;] She runs a long black finger up your throat, lifting your chin up.

$a[&#39;Thank you...&#39;]

She smiles at you and throws you on the bed, your body sinking into the silky whiteness. $E[&#39;Open wide now, girl!&#39;]

As you linger at the reception, you hear the sound of approaching footsteps, followed by guests arriving from different directions. Everyone seems to be gathering at the front, waiting for something.

You stand behind the reception desk, tapping your fingers on the dusty wooden surface. You have a pretty good idea where this is going, but there isn&#39;t anything much you can do right now.

Brief chatter fills the air as Elise, Lavius, Ionut and the werewolf exchange pleasantries, growls and grins at one another.

You hang behind the desk, dodging the occasional side glances from the guests. With every passing minute you feel a sense of urgency to act, yet you don&#39;t know what you could possibly do. The course of events seems set, at least for now.

A few more minutes pass and you hear the familiar tapping of a golden cane, heralding the arrival of Mihai. He walks slowly down the stairs, dressed as impeccably as ever, his gaze taking in his guests one by one.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/characters/mihai2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;char&quot;&gt;
$Mi[&#39;I see that you&#39;ve all gathered - good. I trust that you&#39;ve had a pleasant stay and spent the day catching up to old friends. And I promise, there will be more time for that tomorrow - you are all my guests to stay. But now there are more pressing matters, matters you are all already familiar with. Shall we proceed?&#39;]

With a wave of smiles and nods, the guests make way for Mihai, who crosses the reception area and heads towards the front door. He pauses for a moment, then turns towards you:

$Mi[&#39;You should come too, demon. You can stay with Ionut until we are done. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll appreciate the company.&#39;]

With this, Mihai leaves and the guests follow him one by one. At last, the servant pauses at the door, gesturing you to follow him.

You emerge into the cool evening air, walking side by side with Ionut several paces behind the rest.

The sun has just set behind the mountain ridges and the garden is swimming into the quiet dusk. As the group walks down the path through the garden, you realise that you can see surprisingly well in the dark.

The silhouettes of your companions create an eerie, surreal feeling to the scene: Ionut, limping forward with that odd walk of his, giving away the unnatural angles and shapes of his limbs; Mihai and Lavius, both leading the way with a soft and elegant step that, now that you look a little closer, appears to be barely leaving a mark on the dry grass of the garden; then there is the other pair - the spider and the wolf - moving silently some distance from another, their proportions hinting to their true, inhuman nature.

$A[I guess I&#39;m the only human here-] you think for a second, before realization hits you. $A[Oh.]

A soft breeze blows through the pine trees, releasing their rich scent. It reminds you of your first walk up the stream when you arrived. $A[So much has changed since then, it seems. Alexandra, what did you get yourself into?&#39;]

The short walk is over as Mihai arrives at the entrance to the basement and ushers the guests down the stairs.

$Mi[&#39;Ionut, please  make sure we are not disturbed until the metting is over. The young succubus can stay with you.&#39;]

$Io[&#39;Very vell, Mr. Petrescu.&#39;] The servant nods to Mihai and grabs a nearby shovel, taking a stance. After a few moments he scratches his bald head and turns towards you. $Io[&#39;Ve could sit in the basement, if you wish. Or ve could stay outside.&#39;](if: $elder_arrival is 1)[

Ionut nods and leans on the wall, silently contemplating the darkening sky.

Everything seems so peacuful. Then you remember what is to come - blood and violence, fangs and claws. $A[What happened last time? Who started the fight?]

It&#39;s hard to tell. You found Ionut&#39;s cold body on the outside, and a bloodbath in the room in the basement. It&#39;s clear that you are missing pieces of the puzzle.

Minutes pass and nothing much seems to happen. Dusk turns into night and Ionut rolls a cigar, taking slow puffs in the stillness of the mountain. Somewhere in the forest an owl hoots.

$a[&#39;Alright, let&#39;s go in,&#39;] you say, eyeing the darkening forest.

Ionut nods and heads to the basement, holding the door for you before following in himself.

There are a handful of torches illuminating the stone-tiled room. You notice that the box in the center is no longer there - Mihai and the guests must have taken it with them to the basement. For the moment, it is quiet and peacful - the only sound being the crackling of the torches. Then you remember what is to come - blood and violence, fangs and claws. $A[What happened last time?

Elise waves with her long, thin arm and suddenly the pressure in your head decreases, as if a veil is partially lifted from your eyes. Your vision becomes clearer and as your eyes finally manage to focus on the object in the corner, you see that it is a giant human-sized cocoon. 

$E[&#39;Surprised, dear? You shouldn&#39;t be. After all, it was you who warned me about her. Tsk tsk. Would you like to come and have a closer look?&#39;]

You sit down next to Ionut, deciding to wait and see how things will go. It doesn&#39;t look like you have anything much to do. He passes you the cigar and you take a deep puff of it, blozing a little cloud of smoke into the night.

About an hour passes, when you suddnly see a group of shadowy figures emerge from the forest and head straight to your location. You both raise to your feet.

He is carrying a backpack from which several wires hang out, connecting to a strange metal device around his arm. His companions are brandishing swords, already drawn and ready. The men grinn at you with cold and bloodthirsty eyes.

Ionut swings the shovel at the leader, but he dodges swiftly to the side, punching the servant in the chest with his metal contraption. A burst of sparks follows the impact and Ionut&#39;s body begins to violently shake, a distorted cry coming out of his mouth. Then the servant collapses on the ground, the smell of burnt flesh filling the air.

Your feet take you forward, one hesitant step after the other, until you stand right in front of the cocoon. Your heart is pounding fast, drops of cold sweat soaking into your garments.

Elise plunges a finger at the top of the cocoon and runs it all the way down, slicing the strings of web along the way. Felicia&#39;s body slides down at your feet, naked and covered in bits of silk.

You stand frozen, unable to move, unwilling to process the situation.

You carry Felicia to the bed, letting her down to sink into the silky whiteness of the sheets. She gives a little moan, herclosed eyelids trembling gently as if she&#39;s having a nightmare.

$E[&#39;Pretty catch, isn&#39;t she?&#39;]

Elise climbs on to the bed as well, lying on the other side of Felicia. Your vision shifts again and patches of an alternate view creep through the corner of your eye - long, thin legs dangling around, 6 green eyes staring at you with amused cruelty.

$E[&#39;Do you think that she wanted to be a motherrr? Let&#39;s find out.&#39;]

Elise pull&#39;s Felicia&#39;s hips closer, positioning her own big, round body exactly behind. Then she leans forward...

You can see the precise moment when something slips inside the cat. A shiver runs down her body and her face contracts in a scowl. She is still unconscious but you can feel the tension, as if part of her is aware of what&#39;s going on.

As you keep watching, you see Felicia&#39;s body begin to tense up. She groans with pain, then suddenly relaxes, a soft moan escpaing her lips. In her belly, you can see a small bump that has just appeared under the skin.

The cat woman mumbles something, lost in her nightmare.

You take Felicia&#39;s hand and gently squeeze it, caressing her hair at the same time. Her breathing calms down a little and her expression relaxes. 

$a[&#39;There, there, it&#39;s all going to be alright..&#39;] you whisper in hear ear.

She leans forward and nuzzles her face in your chest, as if looking for a safe place. You can feel tension begin to build again, followed by another relaxation and moan as a new egg slides inside of her.

$A[Why-why am I doing this to her...?!]

A flash of guilt cuts through your mind like a hot iron, but it&#39;s too late to do anything about it now. What&#39;s done is done.

Felicia lifts her head up and lazily opens her eyes,smiling at you. It&#39;s clear that she is very much out of it and struggling to focus.

$M[&#39;Ah, my favorite human...&#39;]

Her hands meekly wrap around you in a hug and your guilt melts away, replaced by the warmth of her body. Your hands find their way onto her naked curves, exploring freely for the first time every inch of her.

Leaning in, you grab Felicia&#39;s face with both hands and kiss her. Her lips have a rich sweetness with a hint of something bitter, like dark chocolate. Even in her unconscious state, she kisses you back and you sink into each other&#39;s embrace.

Your hand moves down from her face to her soft breasts. They are firm but full, somehow exactly as you had imagined them.

You can&#39;t take it any more. The desire is too strong, the moment - too perfect. You quickly slip out of your $suit, throwing it on the floor.

Finally, after all this time, your naked body presses against hers. You realize that you have always been waiting for this moment. Your $breasts against her soft breasts, your $hips rubbing against her small ones.

$A[Damn, I can&#39;t get enough of this!!]

You slide a hand down, feeling her chest, then her tummy. There are several bumps there now, growing with each egg that the spider pushes inside of her. 

Felicia presses firmly against you, as if to let you feel them even better. As her belly expands and her moans grow louder, you begin to feel a hint of jealousy, wanting to partake in the pleasure.

$A[No, I must resist...]

As the thought comes, the cat woman spreads her legs apart, allowing you to see the the thick tube plunged inside of her. Your gaze is instantly pinned to the view, completely mesmerized.

You let your fingers run down her bulging tummy and between her thighs, halting just short of the dark tube thrusting in and out of her. You creep forward cutiously, just at the edge of her folds, looking for the right spot.

As soon as you find it her body tenses up, shaken by a tremor of pleasure.

She grabs you and kisses you passionately, streams of saliva dripping down between your breasts and her breasts.

The tube retracts from her folds and the cat woman rolls on her back, pulling you on top of her. You stare into her blissful expression, your $breasts weighing down against hers. You can feel the big bulge of her tummy right underneath you, and a strange sense of pride from it.

It feels natural, even inevitable. With those soft lips waiting for yours, the action is no longer a choice of reason but an imperative of your primal desires. 

Your own body is aching for attention, jealous of the filled up cat woman and the purity of her pleasure. As you continue making out with her, her hands reach around and spread your legs apart, your ass alerady propped up on her round belly.

You don&#39;t even resist as the tube slides inside of you, pushing deep to the entrance of your womb. You realize now that you were expecting it, it was the natural, inevitable conclusion of everything.

The egg presses against your folds and you stretch to acommodate it, feeling it slide all the way inside, nesting into your womb. You continue kissing Felicia as your own belly begins to grow and stretch on top of hers. Every bulge pushes you deeper into the realm of unfathomable, indescribably pleasure and insanity.

Looking beyond the gate you can see vast cemetery grounds, stretching into the distance. 

The ground on the other side looks rough and barren, with nothing but dry, skeletal trees that extend their long-dead branches towards each other like the fingers of long-dead lovers. Between them you can see numerous grey tombstones, as well as broken statues, covered in lichen.

$A[Woah, this place must be really old... I wonder if those are all people from the local village? Seems too big to be just a family cemetery.]

What really draws your eyes however is a hill in the distance, rising above the field of graves. There is a small building on top of it, perhaps a chapel, or a tomb.

The small path seems to be winding towards it, but the gate is blocking your way. Perhaps you can ask Mihai for a key later, should you be inclined to take a stroll here, and should he be inclined to allow it.

[Approaching the old tree, you are suddenly attentive to the light breeze blowing through its dead branches. They seem to be moving, sometimes with, sometimes against it... or is it just your imaginaiton?

$A[Dammit Alex, you&#39;ve seen *real* monsters already - now scared of a tree?]

Pushing past your irrational fears, you sot down next to the tree, leaning your back at the old, dried out bark. It is actually surprisingly comfortable.

You take a moment to stare at the sky - it&#39;s grey-blue, with a handful of clouds sliced by the sharp mountain peaks far above. It&#39;s actually a very pleasant view.

As you continue to relax and look at the sky, from the corner of your eye you see a hand extending over your left shoulder, its fist tightly clenched in a fist. Your breathing slows down and the seconds stretch into infinity. It&#39;s as if your spine is glued to the tree, all of your muscles completely unresponsive.

Suddenly the hand opens, letting something fall down to the ground. You can see pale skin, long fingernails, and a black tattoo of a circle with arrows just below the wrist.

Then you blink, and the hand is gone.

You rub your eyes. You can swear you saw the hand, but there isn&#39;t anyone else here as far as you can see.

You circle around the tree, just to make sure that no one is hiding behind it. You realize that you&#39;re being silly, but it helps to put your mind at ease.

$a[&#39;Yes, Mistress...&#39;]

$S[&#39;Excellent! Now wait for a moment.&#39;]

Sabrina heads somewhere behind you, probably to the end of the room, as you can hear her opening the large trunk and moving things inside of it. 

You do your best to keep your eyes on the rune on the wall, despite your curiosity to turn around and see what she&#39;s doing. The strange symbol seems to to glow dimly, but it could be just your eyes getting tired.

After a while, Sabrina returns, standing right behind you. Although you can&#39;t see her, you feel her fingers running down your spine, making the hairs of your skin sand on edge.

$S[&#39;Now, sis... I want you to relax.&#39;]

Suddenly you feel a weight on your shoulder and a hundred pointy needles crawling across your skin.

$a[&#39;Wh-what is THAT?!&#39;]

$S[&#39;Just stay clam, you are safe.&#39;]

The thing moves to your back and up to the other shoulder, sending chills down your spine. It feels almost like a giant centipede is crawling on your skin, but you can also fel something cold and slimy...

Gripped by terror, you feel the creature peak its head over your shoulder. You are frozen in fear, your heart racing a million miles an hour. Sabrina told you to keep your eyes on the rune at all times, but you just **have to** know..

Ever so slowly, you turn your head to the left, coming face to face with the monstrocity on your shoulder.

It is one of the moust hideous things you&#39;ve ever seen. A bizarre mix between an arthropode and a mollusc, the creature has a face like a shrimp, with lots of thin apendages sticking around it. It&#39;s body is covered in a partial shell from the bottom, where lots of skeletal legs move it around. But on the top side you can see an area of exposed, slug-like, glistening skin, from which a handful of fleshy antennas with bulbous ends are dangling.

Frozen in shock and fear, you can&#39;t even open your mouth to scream.

$S[&#39;Bad girl!&#39;]

Sabrina slaps you across the face, snapping you out of the stupor. You blink fast and the creature is gone, retracting down your back.

$S[&#39;I told you not to look!&#39;] Now standing in front of you, Sabrina has a cross look on her face.

$a[&#39;I&#39;m sorry, but- this thing! It&#39;s hideous, get it off me!!&#39;]

$a[&#39;They?!&#39;]

$S[&#39;Indeed. But let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves. One is enough for you for now&#39;]

The creature moves across your back, darting left and right as if to explore the new territory. Eventually it crawls down to your butt, it&#39;s head pushing between your legs.

The creature moves back, crawling up and down your back, exploring.

$S[&#39;What do you feel?&#39;]

You try to concentrate. Lots of legs, thin and pointy. $a[&#39;An arthropode...?&#39;] But there&#39;s somehting more. Every now and then you feel a cold touch, something slimy. You imagine a curious snail feeling its environment with its antennae. $A[&#39;I also feel something soft... like a mollusc...&#39;]

With a mix of reluctance and excitement, you move your legs ever so slightly apart, allowing the creature to explore a little further.

Encouraged by the invitation, the creature moves forward, its curious tendrils exploring the curves of your body.

$S[&#39;Very, good, sis,&#39;] says Sabrina encouragingly, patting you on the head. $S[&#39;Curiosity is a good thing. Follow your desires, do not suppress them.&#39;]

Her breasts press against your own $breasts, the piercings of her nipples rubbing against your own. Your head is spinning and you give into her seduction. You close your eyes and feel black and violet, hertaste in your mouth, the gentle caress on your belly.

Her hand continues sliding down between your legs, the tip of her fingers starting to explore the entrance of your folds.

$a[&#39;Ooh~&#39;]

A warm wave of pleasure washes over you and you relax a little more, surrendering to her motions. The embers of desire begin to glow hot in your tummy and before long you find yourself eagerly pushing back against her and twisting your pelvis back and forth with the vampire&#39;s teasing strokes.

She breaks the kiss, pulling back a few inches to stare at your lustful expression.

Sabrina comes in front of you, trasing a finger on you as she goes. With your arms tied in the air, there&#39;s nothing you can do to prevent her leaning in and forcing a deep kiss onto you, her black lipstick smearing over your $lips.

You give Sabrina another small nod and she retracts her hand, freeing the space for the creature to continue its exploration.

The crawling abomination slips further down, the antennae on its head curiously investigating the outer edges of your folds. 

Its presence creates a strange mixture of dread and excitement as you feel the numerous appendages crawling on your skin. You wonder about the things it could do to you, threats and promises of unspeakable sensations from slimy, other-worldly caresses.

The creature moves forward again, now its entire body hanging underneath in the space between your legs, from back to front. The last legs and its tail are hanging just at your lower back, and its head is starting to poke out under your tummy.

$S[&#39;Don&#39;t look down, now! Just keep your eyes straight ahead... good!&#39;]

You follow Sabrina&#39;s instructions, trying to keep your composure. You can feel the creature&#39;s advances slowly becoming bolder as its various... *tools* become acquianted with your anatomy.

Something presses against you, looking for an entrance. It feels cold and slimy, twisting and turning against your skin. The entire creature tightens its grip, pressing its body against you.

$a[&#39;I don&#39;t even know who you are...&#39;] you say carefully.

$Ru[&#39;I am Ruxandra,&#39;] says the ghost, her eyes quinting at you. $Ru[&#39;And who are you, girl?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I am Alex...andra.&#39;] you say with a shy voice. Something about the woman is somewhat intimidating. It could be the giant skull on a stick, but you can&#39;t quite put your finger on it.

$Ru[&#39;And **what** are you, Alex-andra?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I- eeeeh- I&#39;m a succubus...&#39;]

$Ru[&#39;Ha, another monster...&#39;] scoffs the ghost woman. $Ru[&#39;But I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, in **this** place.&#39;]

You shrug and decide to give the ghost a hand with her problem.

Using an old rusty shovel you spot in the nearby bushes, you start digging the soil and piling it on a little black heap to the side. 

After half an hour of hard work, the hole is finally starting to reach a depth of a few feet. You feel like you&#39;re almost there...

At last, you start hitting something other than soil and the outlines of a skeleton slowly emerge under your excavating efforts.

$A[How did I end up digging up bones...]

While you haven&#39;t removed all of the soil, you can already see that there is more than just bones in there. With a resounding *clang!*, your shovel hits something metal. The skeleton has been wrapped up in chains from head to toe.

You step back and scratch your head. $A[Why would they do something like this...]

$a[&#39;Into? But it&#39;s just a piece of wood...&#39;]

$Ru[&#39;Don&#39;t ask, just do it!&#39;] She waves her scepter at you, growing impatient.

You find yourself instinctively obeying her before having the time to really think it through. You lift the necklace up and bring the piece of bone to it, pressing against the wooden surface. The dark runes begin to pulse and wiggle as the wood opens up and swallows the bone inside of it.

You feel a strange light-headedness and a sense of distance from the world around you.

$Ru[&#39;Now, remember these words: $unav2[n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂Ꮈຖ໓s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ŝᶠֆʄʝǟf̴̨̤̣͍̳̣̆̒͜千n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂ᎸŜᶠֆʄʝǟf̴̨̤̣͍̳̣̆̒͜s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ꮈຖ໓n̸̘̣̉͐̃͂千h҉s̵͖͎͖̰̪͆Ŝᶠֆժʂƒʝąղƒd̶s̶f̶j̶a̶♐︎🙰]&#39;] The ghost speaks in a mysterious, other-worldly language. The words resonate in your chest, sink inside of you and fill you throughout. Your entire body is like a vessel for the words, absorbing every sound and tember.

$Ru[&#39;You must go to the tree and give back my necklace! This will free my spirit and I will finally rest in peace. Go!&#39;]

You cum over and over again as the branches engulf your brain, sprouting to the deepest corners of your consciousness.

Your hips grind shamelessly against the living veins, riding wave after wave of pleasure as your mind is slowly being erased.

You feel another presence coming in, a visitor walking into a new home. But there isn&#39;t enough space for both of you.

You are being pushed out, out and away, into the velvet haze, into oblivion and nothingness. There are no memories there, no thoughts, only pleasure.

You climax again, one last time.

-----

After a long moment, a lone tree in the garden lets down a naked woman, who hesitantly makes her first steps in centuries.

$Ru[&#39;Not perfect... but I can work with this.&#39;]

Ruxandra heads into the forest, disappearing from sight. Your mind lingers for a few more moments into the tree&#39;s hollow shell, then (link-reveal-goto: &quot;fades away.&quot;,&quot;DIESUCCUBUS&quot;)[(set: $deathlist to it + (a: &quot;evil tree&quot;))]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1342" name="Rux adv" tags="grave" position="9272,2630" size="100,100">&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$cem&lt;/div&gt;

The ghost seems pensive for a while.

$Ru[&#39;Monsters, creatures like you, they have innate magical abilities. To them it is natural that they have powers - and that **we** don&#39;t.&#39;]

$a[&#39;We?&#39;]

$Ru[&#39;Humans. They think we are good for nothing, can never use magic and even if we did, we wouldn&#39;t be any good at it. But I learned magic - better than any of them! And so they feared me. That is why I was killed and placed here, in a nameless grave - so that their shame can be forever forgotten!&#39;]

You slowly rise to your feet.

The ghost is gone, the forest is quiet. The necklace around your neck seems back to its regular form, albeit a tiny bit heavier.

The only reminder that this wasn&#39;t all a vivid dream is the freshly dug grave.

$A[Well that was... something.]

The old tree stands splintered in half, with no sign of the runes or any other supernatural activity. Its dead branches no longer twist without breeze, instead laying completely motionless.

$A[A sad end...]

As you examine the aftermath of the lightning, you notice something poking from the charred wound. $A[The necklace!]

The peculiar trinket is lying in the center of the tree, right where the lightning split it in half. Oddly enough, it doesn&#39;t seem to have been damaged in the process.

You pick up the necklace and look it over. Just like before, it seems to have a reassuring aura. $A[It must have been some amulet of protection... perhaps why the spirit needed it so badly.]

With quick and precise movements, Elise moves around you, tieing you up with hands behind your back, the white threads contouring your $breasts for her.

You blush but remain silent, sinking further into the weird state of letting the creature do whatever it wants with you.

She goes to a drawer and comes towards you, carrying somehting.

You know exactly where this is going. Might as well let it happen faster.

There&#39;sno point in resisting. The branch plunges into your ear and you give in to the stimulation. The sensation pushes you overboard and your body shakes in a climax, your restrained members trembling from the pleasure.

At the peak of your orgasm, the root slithers its way forward, deeper and deeper.

$Ru[&#39;How easy this was, little whore!&#39;]

It pushes deeper in, defying any expectations of your anatomy. The crawling thing wiggles relentlessly like a fat, giant worm, burrowing into your head. You begin to feel it digging into your brain, a terrifying yet oddly arousing sensation.

As it penetrates deeper still, your eyes begin to roll back and you start climaxing, over and over again.

$Ru[&#39;What a stupid girl you are. I will be taking that brain now - you weren&#39;t using it anyway.&#39;]

Your ear stretches, accomodating its unlikely visitor deeper into your head. You feel your thoughts and consciousness being erased little by little, engulfed in awarm, fuzzy haze. Between your legs there&#39;s a burning desire, unctrollable and all engulfing. Your juices flow like a torrent as pure pleasure washes over you like a tsunami.

You speak the words that the spirit thought you, but reverse the meaning using your knowledge of the occult.

Everything feels surreal, like you&#39;re in some sort of trans. You feel a connection to the world beyond, and for the first time a sense of power and understanding of the ethereal threads that bind it to this reality.

As the last syllable eachoes in the air, the world suddenly grows darker, as if a giant storm cloud has covered the sky.

$Ru[&#39;You...! Those are not the words...!&#39;]

The wind intensifies and the old tree creaks, its branches twisting and turning more than ever before.

$a[&#39;There&#39;s no need to pretend anymore, Ruxandra. I know what you were planning. I know who you are.&#39;]

The runes on the tree begin to glow a bright red, as if a giant flame has been kindled inside. There isn&#39;t any heat that you can feel, only a ghostly breeze that blows your hair.

$Ru[&#39;How- how did you know....&#39;]

$a[&#39;I&#39;m not that dumb you know,&#39;] you chuckle. There&#39;s no need to give her the satisfaction that she had you the first time. The only thing that matters is that you have the last laugh. $a[&#39;Or did you see my horns and breasts and think that I&#39;m only good to be fucked and to do what I&#39;m told?&#39;]

$Ru[&#39;Who told you...? Who are you? Succubi are primitive and dumb...&#39;] the spirit&#39;s voice comes as a low hiss, filled with anger and hate. As the runes continue to glow, her presence seems to wane from this world. 

$a[&#39;No one told me. But you don&#39;t need to know anymore. As you go, just remember that a &#39;dumb bitch&#39; was the end of you!&#39;]

$Ru[&#39;Aaargh...&#39;] her voice comes as a faint whisper, desperately clinging to its last anchor to this world. You can tell that she doesn&#39;t have much time left. $Ru[&#39;Please, spare me... I will do whatever you want... help how I can... please...&#39;]

You grab the necklace from the split tree and put it on. You can immediately feel its protective power enveloping you, much stronger than before. This time, Ruxandra didn&#39;t lie.

$Ru[&#39;Please...&#39;] her voice comes as a dying wail, the sap of the splintered tree running down like black blood.

Taking pitty on her, you lift your hands and begin chanting. The words flow through your mouth on sheer intuition, guided by the power of the necklace and your knowledge of the arcane.

Before your eyes, the tree closes, becoming whole again, but leaving a terrible scar.

$Ru[&#39;Thank you...&#39;]

Her voice is incredibly weak. As the skies above clear up and the wind stops blowing, you can tell that she is still there, but barely. $A[Doubtless she will need time to heal...]

As you stroll back to the Crooked Elm, you take one last glance at the old tree. Its crooked silhouette is barely distinguishable among the other dead things in the garden. Only the strange scar hints at the whole ordeal. $A[I wonder if someone will even notice...]

In any case, you have more urgent matters to worry about now. You can come check on her later. With the necklace reassuringly around your neck, you decide to press on with the matters at hand.

Satisfied with your answer, the black woman deftly attaches the spiders to your metal bars. The weight immediately pulls down on your breasts, creating a much more powerful sensation of servitude. 

$E[&#39;May this remind you always of your place, tsk.&#39;]

You stay in your binds, enjoying the sensation of being restricted and the newly discovered feeling of your nipples being pulled down and stretched. You can already tell that prolongued wearing of the spider piercings will undoubtedly cause some distortion to your body, but somehow the thought excited you.

You picture your $breasts being pushed to their limit, a permanent mark that your mistress has left on you. Just the thought is enough to get you wet.

Noticing your docile acceptence of her new present, Elise gives a small chuckle and pats you on the head again, kindling a warm feeling of satisfaction in your belly.

You take the amulet and slip your head through the thread, letting the golden spider fall between your $breasts.

Almost immediately you can feel a new spring in your step. There is a surge of energy and power in your muscles, the fatigue of the day vanishing away. It isn&#39;t anything superhuman, but it definitely feels like you can take on the world.

A less sophisticated woman could perhaps compare the experience to the consumption of columbian leaves in dubious establishments. But you wouldn&#39;t know about that.

Excited with your newfound agility, you skip around the antique boutique jovially, until Felicia has to pull you to a halt to prevent you from knocking over the items.

$a[&#39;Alright, I&#39;ll give you a hand, but I need to be quick - have to be at The Crooked Elm before sundown.&#39;]

$Y[&#39;Thank you, dear girl. This won&#39;t take long, I promise.&#39;] The old woman pushes her tankard to the side, leaving it almost full. $Y[&#39;My house is just outside the village, not far from &#39;ere. I just need help with a few chores that my old bones can&#39;t handle no more.&#39;]

You nod sympathetically and the kindly old woman slowly gets on her feet. You can almost hear her joints creaking as she makes her way towards the door. $A[Poor granny... must be tough living by herself...]

You get up as well, throwing one last glance at the other patrons at the inn. $A[I suppose they&#39;re not going anywhere either way...]

You follow the old woman out of the inn and to the village center. Ever so slowly she makes her way past the houses of the main street and towards the outskirts, limping on her cane as she goes.

The two of you walk in silence, reaching the end of the village and the familiar $in[hunting cabin]. You can see a small trail continuing beyond, into the old pine forest.

$Y[&#39;It&#39;s not very far dear, just o&#39;er the hill there,&#39;] she says, pointing her cane down the trail. You nod and continue walking after her, leaving the hunting cabin behind.

The path winds between the old pine trees, barely distinguishable from the rest of the forest. After a few more minutes of walking, it comes out at a clearing, where you see a small wooden house. There&#39;s a fence around a modest garden, where a handful of chickens are pecking at the dirt. You can also see an old barn and a few stacks of hay left to dry in the sun.

$Y[&#39;Come on in, dear,&#39;] beckons the kindly old woman, pushing the tiny gate to the side.

The house of the old woman seems like a relic from the olden times, much like many other things from the village. The old wooden pillars, the crooked pans, the handmade furniture with rough, uneven edges - everything feels like stepping into another century, an era of waking with the sun and sleeping by the fire.

On the walls of the hut, you can see a collection of jars with grain and herbs, and other things too, that you can&#39;t quite make out through the dust and cobwebs.

$Y[&#39;Would you like a cup of tea, dear?&#39;]

Not waiting for your answer, the old woman puts a kettle on the stove, throwing in a pinch of this and that from various jars. A peculiar smell fills the room as you wait for the water to boil.

When the brew&#39;s done the gran pours you a cup, sliding it in front of you. The hot steam rises up, tempting your nostrils with its strange aroma.

The gran sits on the opposite end of the table, resting her head on the wall. She seems oddly tired all of a sudden. It seems like you have a moment until the tea is cooling down.

The old woman shifts in her chair. $Y[&#39;Doesn&#39;t matter. Don&#39;t let me blabber on all afternoon, dear. &#39;Ave some tea!&#39;]

You nod at her and lift the cup to your lips, taking a small sip. The taste is bitter but oddly pleasant. The kindly old woman smiles at you and you take another sip. She seems pleased.

You finish the cup in a minute and rise to your feet. Your body feels warmer and somehow heavier.

$a[&#39;Alright, show me what you need a hand with! I better hurry a bit.&#39;]

$Y[&#39;Of course. Right this way, dear. I think the cow needs milking.]

The kindly old woman leads you outside and through the small yard where her chickens are still pecking at the dirt. As you walk, you are beginning to feel an odd *lightheadedness* and a sense of disorientation. 

$A[Something... doesn&#39;t feel quite... right...]

You stumble to the side, the world starting to spin. Your body feels hot and somehow **heavy**, heavier than it&#39;s ever been. You pant heavily, starting to sweat.

$A[Can&#39;t... breathe...]

The grass feels cool and soft under your palms. It&#39;s so green, so fresh, so *juicy*. You are walking down on all fours through the yard. Why are you here? Where are you going?

$Y[&#39;This way, dear,&#39;] a kindly voice reaches your ears. An old woman is holding the door to the barn open for you. The place seems inviting and somehow *right*.

You crawl into the barn, feeling dizzy and disoriented. Have your breasts always felt this big and heavy?

Your body continues to grow hot and you feel a tingling sensation on the top of your head as two small horns begin to pop up. You shake your head in confusion, growing frightened.

$Y[&#39;There, there, it&#39;s okay girl. Nothing to worry about.&#39;]

A caring hand guides you forward into the barn, leading you towards a wooden stand. With every step you feel your hips become thicker and larger. The base of your spine extends from your back as a short, fluffy tail begins to dangle between your legs.

You don&#39;t know what to do. Your mind swimming into a $A[haze], the only option left is to $A[follow and obey].

You let yourself be lead to the wooden stand, where you lean on top of a beam. It feels good to be relieved of the growing $A[weight] of your body.

Just as you try to relax, a hand grabs one of your swollen breasts and forcefully pulls on it, squuezing a stream of milk into a bucket below.

$a[&#39;Aaaah!&#39;] you cry out in pain and surprise, but you find yourself incapable of backing out.

$Y[&#39;There, there, dear, everything is going to be all right,&#39;] reassures you a kindly voice, then a hand repositions you over the bucket again.

The woman continues to mutter to herself as her fingers work, squeezing stream after stream from your tits down into the bucket. The pace of her motions is rhythmic and somehow soothing. The rough, wrinkled skin of her bony fingers is like a perfect fit for the soft tenderness of your breasts.

The sensation is not pleasant, but you feel compelled to stay and endure it. After all, what else could you do?

$Y[&#39;The old times were good to us,&#39;] the old woman nods her head. $Y[&#39;Everything was simple. Life was good. Why change?&#39;]

You run a hand on the rough surface of the table. It looks crude, but durable. Must have lasted over a century.

$a[&#39;Mihai seems to think that a bit of modernity will do the village good. Move with the times, that sort of thing.&#39;]

The gran frowns at that. $Y[&#39;Ah, Mihai. That boy still has the temper of youth about him. He&#39;ll come to his senses once his father pulls him by the collar.&#39;]

There is a strange relief in the process, a deep-rooted need being fulfilled. It&#39;s natural, irresitable, *inevitable*.

As your breasts swell with milk to the brim, ready to burst, so must someone do the milking, squeeze them hard and relieve you of this growing burden. 

Every repetition of the motion solidifies your complacency. How could you ever think to run away or protest? You $A[need] this. In many ways, the old woman is taking $A[care] of you by doing you this service. 

You bow your head and stifle your whimpers.

$Y[&#39;Such a wonderful thing, the spirit of youth...&#39;]

With the corner of your eye you see the old woman grab a wooden cup and dip it into the bucket, then bring it to her lips. She tilts her head back, swallowing the entire cup in a few mighty gulps. When she looks at you again, her face is completely different - younger and stronger, with an iron smile and piercing gaze.

$Y[&#39;Thank you, dear. This is exactly what I needed.&#39;]

As her hands resumer her work, you are starting to feel a growing tiredness. You can barely keep your eyes open, your body collapsing on the wooden beam underneath you.

$Y[&#39;There, there, everything will be alright, dear,&#39;] says a reassuring voice, though it seems to be very far now. Your mind is sleeping farther and farther into the welcoming darkness.

You spot your $suit, lying casually in the garden, not far from you. The old woman is nowhere to be seen, though you can hear noises coming from the inside the house.

You reach towards your clothes, but stumble back with a loud clang. There is a rope around your neck, decorated with a little cowbell.

Suddenly the noises from the kitchen stop and you hear footsteps heading your way.

You dash forward, grabbing your $suit and then running towards the end of the garden. Still naked, you sprint around the chickens and jump over the small wooden fence. Just as you hear the creak of the door opening, you manage to slip between the first pine trees, hiding yourself from view. You carry on running for a while, until finally, you stop.

You are alone in the forest. You take a moment to catch your breath, leaning on a tree. It seems that you are safe.

$A[Phew... did not expect THAT to happen...]

Gathering back your clarity of mind, you get dressed again and start walking in the general direction of the village. After several minutes you begin to recognize the landscape and see the familiar outline of the $in[hunting cabin]. $A[Made it back!]

As the heat in your body increases, you feel your breasts beginning to swell. They fill out your clothes and begin to stretch them out, pushing to the limit. You are starting to fear that your $suit is going to burst and your enlarged bossom will spill out in front of you, taking alife of its own.

As the two of you cross the inn, you feel a handful of inquisitve stares fall on you. You blush and lower your eyes to the floor, hoping to conceal your embarrassment. You may not have the cow bell anymore, but the old woman still herds you around in much the same way.

She leads you to the other end of the room, and opens a small door to a storage room, inviting you in.

$Y[&#39;You made the right choice, dearie. Nothing wrong with accepting the occasional defeat. Now come on here.&#39;]

She takes an old metal bucket from a shelf and places it at her feet, sitting on a small box for support. You hesitate for a moment. $A[Thank god no one can see this...]

You pull your top up, struggling to get it off over your swollen breasts. When you finally manage to succeed, they hang down even further, pulling you with their enormous weight. 

$A[What the hell did I get myself into...]

But it&#39;s too late to back off now. Swallowing the last of your pride, you kneel over the bucket.

Lavius completely shreds your $suit to pieces. Your naked body glistens in the darkness, beads of sweat covering your skin. The vampire runs his hands along it, feeling every curve. Reaching your arms, he places them in an outstretched position above your head and you soon feel the soft touch of leather wrapping around your wrists.

You let him tie you up. After all, resistance is futile. You feel completely defenceless and exposed, your flower twitching as he stares hungrily at it. $A[Maybe this is exactly what I wanted...]

Getting on top of you, his teeth sink into the side of your neck, puncturing your artery. Then you feel him penetrate you, starting to pump a rhythm as the blood is drained out of your body.

Your head spins. There is no pain.

The thrusts continue, filling your aching pussy over and over again.

Your body twitches as you feel yourself grow weaker.

He fucks you harder and faster. indiscernible screams escape your mouth.

$a[&#39;Aaah!&#39;] your lusty moan invites him deeper and he takes the opportunity to come closer, pressing his body against yours.

$L[&#39;You city girls, always so eager, so willing, so **naive**...&#39;] his voice whispers behind your ear, before his lips touch your neck, sending a wave of goosebumps through your naked skin. Then his teeth sink in and the pain mixes with the pleasure, making your head spin.

Lavius pauses for a moment, grabbing you by the hair and twisting your head to the side. $L[&#39;Did not expect you to be such a slut, Alexandra.&#39;]

You move your butt into posiiton and he slides inside of you, sending a wave of pleasure up your spine. You can feel his entire body tensing, growing, transforming. He becomes faster, stronger, more bestial and more alive. A pair of bih black wings engulf you in their dark embrace.

$L[&#39;I will kill you, you know that right?&#39;]

$A[&#39;Aaah! More! More!&#39;]

His pace accelerates again, just as your vision starts to become dark. Your body grows numb, becoming a ragdoll to be moved and used by his desires. Just as you feel your consciousness slipping, he finally ejaculates, holding your almost lifeless body in his dark grip as he fills you to the brim.

$L[&#39;That&#39;s not what I told you,&#39;] he scolds you a hand grabbing you by the hair.

Unfettered, you press forward, wrapping your lips around his cock as your head begins to bob back and forth. Lavius still seems conflicted what to do, but you can feel him growing hard in your mouth and you double your efforts to please him.

$L[&#39;I don&#39;t like disobedient girls, do you know that?&#39;]

he places a hand on your throat and squeezes. Your airflow is almost cut out, but you remain undettered. Your lips move even faster, sucking him up and down.

$L[&#39;You&#39;ll pay for this...!&#39;] he groans, squeezing you even tighter. You almost black out, but manage to maintain your efforts a little longer. Finally, with a nother groan, you feel him twitch inside of your mouth, emptying a big load down your throat.

His hand pushes you away from him, down on the floor. $L[&#39;I suppose sometimes one just has the irresistable urge to suck... now place your hands on the wall, sweetheart.&#39;]

You try to stay as steady as you can as the old woman&#39;s deft hands do their work, squeezing stream after stream from your swollen tits into the bucket.

As she carries on her work you feel a strange peace and lightheadedness and a strange acceptance of your condition. You are growing more docile and passive.

Ever so slowly your body is relieved from the burden and your breasts begin to return to their previous shape and size. There is a strange satisfaction in the process, almost a gratification for a job well done. By the time it&#39;s completely over, you feel almost regretful that it didn&#39;t last a little longer.

$Y[&#39;There, that wasn&#39;t so bad now, was it?&#39;] the old woman winks at you, then grabs her bucket and heads to the door. $Y[&#39;Perhaps I&#39;ll be seeing you around, dear. If you wish to help a poor old woman some more.&#39;]

She cackles to herself and waddles out with the bucket of milk by her side.

You make a tentative step forward, but almost fall again, before Lavius manages to steady you. It&#39;s clear that you won&#39;t be going far in this condition. What&#39;s worse still, you can tell that *everyone* is starting to watch you.

It&#39;s finally becoming clear what he wants. You sigh and lean in to his crotch. He gives you a little assistance and soon enough you have your lips wrapped around his cock, head bobbing up and down. His hand is guiding your pace and you surrender yourself to the situation.

After several minutes of this, you feel him tense up and shoot a sticky load in your mouth, which you eagerly gulp down. $A[At least it&#39;s a free charge...]

You pull your top up, struggling to get it off over your swollen breasts. When you finally manage to succeed, they hang down even further, pulling you with their enormous weight.

A wave of rage washes over you. Not because she killed you. You have been killed before. But this time it&#39;s different. She used you, she *betrayed* you. And you only wanted to help.

You pick it up and turn it around between your fingers with curiosity. It feels light and somehow calming to the touch. Through a feeling that you can&#39;t quite explain, you know with cetainty that the bone from the ghost is still inside.

$A[Can she really see anything down there...? Or is Lavius just messing with me...?]

There is something about the water that makes you feel a little uneasy. Black and deep, you can feel it somehow pulling you in, like un *appel du vide* when standing on the edge of a deep canyon. Your heart rate accelerates.

$L[&#39;Narcissa! Komm hier meine Liebe! Ich habe ein wunderschönes Paar Titten für dich.&#39;] The vampire&#39;s voice cries over your ear, surprising you with the unfamiliar tongue. There is however one thing that you manage to pick out.

$A[Narcissa! Her name is Narcissa!]

The pull from the dark water somehow becomes stronger. You are all too aware of your naked chest hanging just over the surface, and yet you can&#39;t pull away. Slowly, something emerges from the depths.

$L[&#39;There&#39;s no need to be shy, love! Mihai may have dressed you all up as a butler, but you&#39;re still a succubus...&#39;]

Lavius wraps his other hand around your waist and pulls you closer towards him, then leans in for a kiss. You reluctantly open your lips and accept his. 

His kisses you wildly, invading your mouth with a taste of wine and fruit. Having hit on a roadblock between your legs, his hand reaches up and groped you through the uniform, squeezing your $breasts and playing with your nipples as best as he can. Yet again, the uniform goes a long way to mitigate the effect, preserving your dignity to any onlookers. $A[No doubt if I was wearing anything else, he would have had my tits out by now...]

Finally Lavius pulls away, giving you a mixed look. You let your eyes fall to your lap, blushing.

Narcissa swirls around angrily, her eyes scowling at you. Her aura is rapidly fading and now you can see all of her for the monstrocity that she truly is.

She darts towards the surface and you leap back, just in time to avoid to grasp of her angry tentacles. She breaks above the surface, tentacles pushing her up from the edge of the box, her wet sewaweed hair dripping down her naked breasts.

$N[&#39;Our love is stronger than you know! I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s filling your holes, whore - you will never have him! He will use you and discard you like all the rest! But for me - oh for me he would move mountains, he would suffer and endure, he would kill! For me!!&#39;]

She swings another tentacle at you and then plunges back down into the box, splashing water all around. 

You wait for a minute to make sure that she&#39;s really gone, then you carefully approach.The water is dark and still. There is no sign of Narcissa.

You take a deep breath, trying to piece everything together. Lavius, the werewolf. Elise. The box in the basement.

$a[&#39;Lavius! He is the one orchestrating the whole thing!] 

The creature leans in closer. You are beginning to see two flaming red eyes staring right at you, the outline of its monstrous jaw spreading open.

You try to free yourself again but it&#39;s no use. Your body is now completely trapped into the slimy puddle. Through the holes of your tattered clothes, black tendrils begin to latch onto your $breasts and tummy.Their touch sends shivers of disgust and pleasure making your body shake uncontrollably. 

$A[Perhaps if I just give it what it wants it will leave me alone afterwards...]

Some part of you fears that if you give up the fight now you will never make it out of here but it is so tempting to just let go and abandon yourself to the pleasure.

You take quick, short breaths, trying to regain a semblance of control over your body. You are still down on all fours, shaking and sweating, overwhelmed by sensations.

Looking down at the dirt beneath you, you begin to recognize the objects you have been stepping on - skulls and bones, scraps of metal, wood and other unrecognizable chunks, all jumbled together in heaps and piles.

$A[What the fuck....?]

You lift your chin up and scour your surroundings. You are in a massive subterranian space, littered with massive piles of stuff, some several meters tall. You appear to have fallen in the center of it, with the walls in the distance barely visible even with your new dark vision.

Just as you begin to feel a wave of hopelessness, you notice a small opening in one of the walls.

$a[&#39;It&#39;s a door!&#39;] You cry out loud, scrambling to get up to your feet again. The exit is some distance away, but you should be able to make it there.

Squashing ancient remains of forgotten things, you begin to make your way towards the door. Fuelled by the awakening energy within you, you put a stride in your step. Your clothes are torn and tattered from the fall, but that doesn&#39;t matter. In fact, having your breasts hanging out freely is somewhat empowering. If anyone were watching you now, they&#39;d see a proud succubus, making her way through death with a smile on her face.

$A[Hell, might even fuck the werewolf once I get out of here, just because I **can**...]

Your thoughts quickly trail of to memories of passion and dreams of future lustful encounters. You don&#39;t even realize how easy it is to slip into the beautiful delirium. Your mind is already elsewhere, your heartbeat quickening, a stream of sweet juices flowing down your inner thigh.

You stumble and fall, rolling down the pile you were climbing. 

You try to push yourself up but something skitters right in front of your face, making you instantly recoil.

$a[&#39;Eeeek!!&#39;]

You see a long, black body with hundreds of legs, darting in and out of the piles of remains around you. The movement is almost completely silent, with only a gush of air left behind.

With your clothes torn to shreds and your naked skin exposed, suddenly you feel truely and fully vulnarable. You don&#39;t know what is lurking in the darkness, but all of the guesses make your skin crawl and send your mind spinning.You look left and right trying to catch a glimpse of the monstrosity. 

Just when you think it has moved on, it errupts from underneath you, coiling around your body like a giant snake.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pit_centipede.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;  align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

You are frozen in terror. A milion needle-like legs are dancing all over your body. You can&#39;t see what it is but you dare not look back for fear of what you might find.

You carefully place the lid back over the box, hoping that no one will ask questions about all the water splashed around.

$A[so... Lavius is doing all this for Narcissa? I definitely took him for a playboy, not a doomed lover... guess you really can&#39;t judge a book by its cover.]

You want to shake your head, to pull away, to get a grip, but instead you remain just as transfixed as before.

$N[&#39;Pull your tits out for me, whore. I want to see the view that Lavius had.&#39;]

You reach in and get your $breasts out from your cleavage, letting them hang over the water. You feel $a[hot] and $a[hazy].

The water becomes darker as you continue plunging downwards. You are getting closer and closer to the divine aura. Finally, your fingers reach her extended hand and you grab it. The sensation is almost orgasmic.

Narcissa pulls you in and you fall into her embrace. She feels like a giant flower whose tendrils gently wrap around your limbs and spread them apart. Her hand caresses your cheek while you begin to feel a growing burning sensation in your lungs and a dizzyness in your head.

$N[&#39;Do you want some air?&#39;] she smiles at you lovingly. $N[&#39;You can have some, if you behave. It&#39;s. Right. Here.&#39;]

You sit down next to Ionut. It doesn&#39;t look like you have anything much to do, apart from trying to calm down your nerves. It has been a long and eventful day.

He passes you the cigar and you take a deep puff of it, blozing a little cloud of smoke into the night.

About an hour passes, when you suddnly see a group of shadowy figures emerge from the forest and head straight to your location. You both raise to your feet.

$Io[&#39;Who there?&#39;] shouts the servant, shovel ready in his hand.

The figures approach closer, with the leader at the head of the part. He walks up to a few feet from you, stopping to eye you up and down. Your heart is pounding. You look nervously at the sky, but everything seems normal.

For a brief moment, everything seems to be going according to plan. Then the fallen leader flicks something and punches the elder in the chest, shoves the metal device straight in his heart.

Sparks fly everywhere and a terrible screech pierces the night. After a long moment, the body of the Elder falls to the ground, charred and fuming.

With a confident swagger, the men step forward, surrounding you. There is nowehre left to go. You manage to dodge the first two swings, but a third one catches you from behind. You stare at the blade sticking out of your chest, a stream of blood soaking your $suit.

A liquid warmth begins to spread through your body from the place of the bite and you begin to feel lightheaded and confused. Your pussy feels hot ,needy, empty. You want something inside it so badly. Before you even realize it, your back is arching down, your head pushed obediently to the ground and your ass lifting up, ready and waiting.

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pit_centipede.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

The legs crawl some more as the creature coils around your body and positions something against you. You know that this is wrong and repulsive, and yet you yern for it. You are revulsed by your arousal, and aroused by your revulsion.

As the liquid heat continues to spread through your body, it reaches your head, stiflig all thoughts of resistance. 

The creature is now into position, and you can feel something long and hard pushing against your ass. You feel a wave of disapointment and neediness as your wet pussy screams for attention. You could easily reposition yourself, but that would be admitting exactly how much you want it.

(if: $pitR2 is &quot;ass&quot;)[You couldn&#39;t bear the humiliation of begging for it, so you resign yourself to staying in place and waiting for the monster to do what it wants.

The hard thing slides inside your ass, stretching it with ease. Your breaths begin to accelerate and your gaping pussy twitches with and unfulfilled desire. Within moments you are already regretting your decision but it is too late.

Suddenly the shaft expands and you feel something bulbous push against your back entrance. You twitch and resist for a few moments but then your hole stretches wider, letting the round object slip inside of you.](else:)[Swallowing your shame and ego, you lift your ass up, guiding the prodding member straight into your open pussy. A gush of pleasure overwhelms you and you begin grinding against it in a lustful frenzy. You don&#39;t care if it may look shameful or pathetic since ther is nobody to see you now. 

Your movements are interrupted by something large and bulbous moving down the member inside you. It presses against your folds, pushing them apart as it begins to travel deeper inside of you. It reaches your womb, and tension begins to rise before it finally slips inside, making your entire bosy shake violantly from pleasure.]

&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pit_centipede.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;  align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

Your heart is pounding in your chest as the reality of the situation creeps upon you. Terror begins to rise but then the liquid warmth returns lulling you into a haze of lust and pleasure. By the time the second round object comes, your hole is already waiting for it and opens willingly, letting it slide inside.

$a[&#39;Aaaahh!&#39;] Lusty moans escape your lips with each new sphere pushed inside of your body. Your thoughts begin to recede and you no longer remember who you are or where you are. All that you know is the liquid warmth, the fullness of your body, and the pleasure of your hole stretching and closing again and again as the comfortable pressure inside you increases. 

A milion feathers are gently caressing your skin and you curl up, letting them envelop you in an almost motherly embrace. You can no longer open your eyes, nor do you wish to. Your mind dissolves into (link-reveal-goto:&quot;lust and darkness.&quot;,&quot;DIESUCCUBUS&quot;)[

$a[&#39;Fuck fuck fuck, not again....!!&#39;]

As terror grips you, you feel the familiar $in[deep and primal force] surge through your body. It begins in your belly and bursts up like a roaring flame. 

$a[&#39;Aaaaah!!&#39;] You scream off the top of your lungs as the darknes condenses rapidly around you, forming $a[**two giant wings**] on your back. You begin flapping them frantically, the speed of your fall slowing down with every massive swing. It is clumsy and imperfect and you have no clue what the hell you&#39;re doing, but somehow you regain a fraction of control.

You drop into a pile of bones that cracks and splinters as you roll down the side of it violently. Your body hits a bump and for a moment you are sent flying into the air again, arms flailing, before you hit the surface again, splashing bits around you.

You are in the pit. Again.

$A[Alright, Alex, just clam down... perhaps it will be different this time.]


You tentatively get to your feet, wobbling slightly. The $in[stale smell of decay] is already hitting you. You need to hurry. The good thing is that your vision seems to have activated on its own this time. You can $in[see in the dark]. And you can see the door.

Squashing ancient remains of forgotten things, you begin to make your way towards the door. You feel empowered by your new abilities. You can do this.

The monster leaps on top of you, pinning you down, its claws digging down and shredding your new clothes. 

History repeats itself.

Your frail, feminine body trembles in terror as the teeth sink into the delicate flesh without hesitation. There is little mercy for you this time and you convulse in agony as the beast tears off chunk after chunk, your helpless limbs flailing in the swelling pools of blood and splattering crimson spots all over the remains of your $suit.

The force is finally sapped from your body and the pain fades into a dull background. The last thing you feel is your bracelet getting warmer, before (link-reveal-goto:&quot;the darkness takes you&quot;,&quot;DIE&quot;)[

You take the familiar trail towards the village, navigating by the light of the full moon and the sound of the creek running by the road. The forest seems oddly peaceful.

$A[With all the monsters gathered at the manor, this might actually be the best time for a night walk...]

You continue walking for about a quarter of an hour, slowly descending towards the village. Just as you begin to wonder if this is really going to work, you spot a faint light coming among the trees on the other side of the creek. 

$A[That must be them!]

You feel your heartbeat increasing. (if: $deathlist contains &quot;torture&quot;)[The last time the men got their hands on you, you ended up nailed to a chair and electrocuted to death. A cold chill runs down your spine. But you know you have to do this.]

You cross the creek and dive among the trees, following the flicker of light. Soon enough a familiar mix of rugged voices reach your ears, confirming that you are on the right track.

Eventually the trees part, revealing a small clearing where a camp fire is blazing, surrounded by a few shadowy figures. The men are relaxed in a conversation, tossing a handful of dice on a board and smoking cigars. You can see a few bags thrown around, as well as their weapons leaning against a tree.

You continue approaching the camp and a few branches crack under your feet, suddenly alerting the men to your presence. They raise to their feet, reaching for their weapons.

$rando[&#39;Stay where you are!&#39;] The leader steps forward, eyeing you up and down. The rest of the men exchange glances.

You suddenly realize that they do not remember your previous encounters. To them, you are a strange woman with horns that has just stepped out of the darkness. $A[They are probably used to seeing lots of non-humans, but perhaps not succubi...]

A heavy silence hangs in the air.

$a[&#39;Good evening, gentlement,&#39;] you say with a warm, quiet voice. Mustering your confidence, you step forward in a casual, relaxed way, despite the clubs and knives aiming for your throat. $a[&#39;Why so tense? Never seen a woman before?&#39;]

You lean on a tree, giving them a cheeky look

$rando[&#39;Don&#39;t test our patience, demon. Who are you and what are you doing here?&#39;]

The leader approaches you and you can see the metal device already mounted on his arm. $A[It&#39;s the thing that took out Ionut... I need to find a way to disable it!]

You try to study the device without making your intentions obvious, but you can&#39;t get a very clear view of it. The tension is rising in the air. You will need to difuse the situation if you want any chance of not getting clubbed to death in the coming seconds.

$in[Time is ticking.]

You could try to ruse your way out of the situation and convince the men that you&#39;re here to help. Or you could see if your charms are enough to make them think with their dicks rather than their heads...

$a[&#39;Relax, fellas. It is Lavius that sent me here.&#39;] You wave a hand non-chalantly to lower their weapons, but are met with dubious looks.

$rando[&#39;Lavius? Why would he send you?&#39;]

You look the leader dead in the eye. He is a rough man and you can tell that he&#39;s used to smelling lies. However you have one big advantage he doesn&#39;t know about - you&#39;ve seen the future. You&#39;ve been there. This gives you a quiet confidence. $in[Your mind is clear. You are in control.]

$a[&#39;Why, to assist you with the plan, of course. Things have changed. We need to adapt.&#39;]

The man raises an eyebrow. $rando[&#39;**We?** he never mentioned you, doll.&#39;]

You move forward and inch towards the man&#39;s face. Close and personal. You can smell his sweat, see the unshaven patches on his beard. Your horns are almost poking at his skin. Your $lips blossom in an arrogant smile. $a[&#39;Do you think you are his only trump card, little man? And that he tells you everything, always? That he would have no back-up if things went wrong?&#39;]

You can see the discomfort in his eyes and the thoughts racing in his mind. But you don&#39;t leave him long to ponder.$a[&#39;The Elder has awakened and he will be guarding the entrance along with Ionut. Your device is not well enough equipped to deal with him. Not now anyway. You will need to increase the power.&#39;]

$rando[&#39;How do you know all of that...?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I told you, silly. Lavius sent me - I&#39;m here to help. And I know that you don&#39;t know how to reconfigure that thing. So if you want our plan to succeed, turn your back and let me configure the device.&#39;]

It seems that your arguments have managed to convince the leader. Relucatntly, he turns away and presents you with the large backpack that is connected to the device on his arm.

The backpack he&#39;s wearing is hosting what looks like a large battery, surrounded by metal cyllinders, capacitors and all sorts of wires. You can hear a low electrical hum coming from it. 

$L[Lavius has gone a long way in his research it seems...]

The device looks like something straight of the 19th century, perhaps from Tesla&#39;s personal sketchbook. However there is more to it. For all the shiny copper and glass, you also spot other, more sinister details. Runes etched in plaques, crystlas connected in strange ways. You can&#39;t quite tell where the classical technology ends and the occult begins.

Despite the strange additions to the device, you manage to quickly locate the control board. It has all sorts of knobs and gauges. Luckily for you, you&#39;ve once studied these things.

$a[&#39;I will increase the voltage to maximum,&#39;] you explain to the men, pointing to a knob and turning it all the way up. $a[&#39;This will drain the power very quickly, but should be strong enough to deal with the old Petrescu. Use it sparingly and wait for the right moment.&#39;]

The men look over your shoulder and nod approvingly, though you can tell that they don&#39;t really understand it. $A[Perfect... just what I was counting on!] As you make a grand point of explaining how the voltage should be kept at a max, you descretely turn the amperage way down. $A[This will barely give a zap now... fools!] 

As you finish setting up the device and step back, nobodody seems to have noticed your trickery.

$a[&#39;Alright, fellas - you&#39;re all set! I think we should get moving now, before anyone notices my absence.&#39;]

The leader turns around, flexing his arm with the device. He gives you a slightly confused look, but doesn&#39;t find any objection. $rando[&#39;You heard her men! Time for action.&#39;]

The group quickly packs the camp and prepares for departure.

$rando[&#39;Step aside, servant! We can do this the easy way or the hard way!&#39;] The men cheer, lifting their weapons and ready to fight.

$Io[&#39;Get avay!&#39;]

Ionut swings the shovel at the leader, but he dodges swiftly to the side, hitting the servant on his head with a bat. Ionut sways, but doesn&#39;t fall. 

$R[&#39;That washn&#39;t nice!&#39;] comes a voice from above. Just on time, a giant shadow drops from the sky, squashing the leader to the ground. The rest of the group halts.

$rando[&#39;Now, get him when he falls unconscious!&#39;]

The leader swings with his arm, burying the metal device straight in the Elder&#39;s chest. There is a tiny spark that fizzles into the night.

$R[&#39;Ish that all?&#39;]

You can feel the horror set in the group. The men turn towards you with angry stares, but it&#39;s too late. An arm flies off, spraying you with a splatter of blood. The metal contraption hangs on to it, cables torn.

The leader&#39;s scream pierces the night, then stops abruptly, stifled by another spray of blood. The rest of the men forget about you and run for the forest.

$L[&#39;What wonderful maids Mihai has found... I wish you were serving **me**, dear. We would have such fun!&#39;]

You meekly nod at him.

$L[&#39;But I promised you food, and a gentleman always keeps his promise. Why don&#39;t you come down here and get your reward?&#39;]

Even as he says he won&#39;t keep you waiting, you can see that Lavius takes a great care in unbuckling his belt as slowly and methodically as possible. Your hungry stare probably speaks enough for him. 

$A[That smug bastard....]

You wish you could hate him, but it&#39;s just making you even hornier. As you kneel down on the ground with nothing but a black skirt, you can sense a handful of resiliant stems of grey grass rubbing against your wet slit. You are so hot and sensitive that even that is enough to make you twitch with anticipation.

After taking his sweet time to enjoy your longing look, Lavius finally slips his cock out and grabs your horn, giving you a playful tug towards him.

You lean in forward and open your lips, taking him in your mouth. It isn&#39;t something that you thought you&#39;d see yourself doing in broad day in the middle of the garden, but now that you&#39;re in the act it somehow feels natural to you.

Lavius seems very happy to just lean back and let you do the work for him. Occasionally he gives your horns a little tug, adjusting your pace to his liking. 

As you slide your lips back and forth down his shaft you are lulled into a familiar, pleasant $a[**haze**]. It is a place in your mind that is always there to welcome you. You feel aroused, but it&#39;s more than that. You feel **good**.

Despite the compromising situation, $in[you feel in control]. You are sexy and seductive, but totally in charge of your faculties. Your lust and hunger are at bay and you are confident that you can use this opportunity to your advantage.

Your moans continue to echo loudly in the camp. You can no longer control yourself. Tied and restricted, with your legs held forcefully spread, the feeling of submission and lust is just too much for you.

$Io[&#39;Who there?&#39;] shouts the servant, approaching furiously with shovel ready in his hand.

You are way behind and it&#39;s dark, so Ionut can&#39;t see you. But you see him and the leader approaching menacingly.] 

$rando[&#39;Step aside, servant! We can do this the easy way or the hard way!&#39;] The men cheer, lifting their weapons and ready to fight.

$Io[&#39;Get avay!&#39;]

Ionut swings the shovel at the leader, but he dodges swiftly to the side, hitting the servant on his head with a bat. Ionut sways, but doesn&#39;t fall. 

Unfuriated, the leader swings with his arm, burying the metal device straight into Ionut&#39;s chest. There is a tiny spark that fizzles into the night.

(if: (history:)&#39;s last is &quot;brigands lewd win3&quot;)[$rando[&#39;What the fuck? That girl did something! Get her!!&#39;]](else:)[$rando[&#39;What the fuck? She tricked us!!&#39;] ]

Ionut smacks the leader on the head, knocking him down. Unfortunately, the rest of the men are surrounding you.

&#39;You&#39;ll pay for this, bitch!&#39;

There is nowehre left to go. Ionut is still too far to help you. You manage to dodge the first two swings, but a third one catches you from behind. You stare at the blade sticking out of your chest, a stream of blood soaking your $suit.

Eagerly, the rest of the men flock around you and you give in to the task of servicing them all to their heart&#39;s content.

You suck and lick and kiss, over and over again. With every load down your throat another bead blossoms in crimson, until soon enough your bracelet is completely recharged.

$A[This turned into quite the feast...]

As the beads turn crimson, your $a[**hunger**] subsides and you find yourself more and more $in[in control]. You give the men the time of their life, performing elaborate techniques that they can only dream of.

Soon enough your little group turns into a chaotic pile of grunting bodies, all of which are fighting for your attention.

In the commotion, you manage to $in[discretely adjust the leader&#39;s metal device], disconnecting a few wires and swapping their places.

$A[This ought to do the trick...!]

After a long and hard session, the men are finally satisfied. They lay on the ground, exhausted and happy. Finally, the leader prods them to move.

$a[&#39;Where else would you be going? It&#39;s the only place around.&#39;] Your answer seems innocent enough, but you can tell that the man is not happy.

$rando[&#39;I don&#39;t think this is a good idea.&#39;]

$a[&#39;But I work there. I could lead the way. We welcome guests at any time!&#39;]

The men exchange worried looks. Your persona seems to still hold, and after a while they reluctantly agree.

$rando[&#39;Alright, fellas - let&#39;s get moving!&#39;]

The group quickly packs the camp and prepares for departure.

$S[&#39;As a young man with little experience, you were only following what simple biology was showing you - tension and release, pleasure and satisfaction.&#39;]

You open your mouth to object, but Sabrina hushes you with a finger. $S[&#39;I am not blaming, only stating. The male orgasm follows a simple trajectory, and you can hardly be blamed for following what is natural to you. Now, as a woman, you have a glimpse from the other side - a glimpse of a path with no single destination, a complex journey of giving and receiving. In reality it is a path that anyone can walk - given enough time and perseverance - but it seems that in this instance, fate has forced your hand, **sister**.&#39;] As she says the last word, Sabrina grins at you and you feel her hand sliding between your thighs. She gently pushes them apart and worms a finger in between your folds, teasing you playfully.

$a[&#39;Aaaahhh!&#39;]

$S[&#39;Let go. Do what comes natural. Follow your impulses.&#39;]

Her velvet lips looks like black cherries as she smiles at you. You can feel the heat rising in your body like a dam breaking in half, threatening to flood your mind with everything that you&#39;ve been bottling up through the years.

$S[&#39;Good girl,&#39;] she grins at you. Your eyes lock as her finger slowly slide inside of you. You can tell that she&#39;s taking in every change in your expression, taking pleasure in your pleasure.

$a[&#39;Ah, right there....!&#39;]

Her fingers hit a spot and your eyes roll up in pleasure, your lips barely stifling moans of pleasure as she plays you like a fiddle and takes you higher and higher with every movement.

$S[&#39;Enjoy the journey, sis. Be in the moment.&#39;]

You close your eyes and abandon yourself to her. The pleasure is building, but you can tell that it&#39;s not about the destination. It&#39;s the journey, the exploration.

The touch of her lips blossoms on your neck and your fingers curl in pleasure. She makes her way up slowly, reaching your ear, which she gently nibbles. 

$a[&#39;This... this feels good&#39;]

You kiss Sabrina and push her back, making her fall on her back with you on top of her. For a brief moment a surprised expression washes over her face, but then her velvet lips stretch into a smile.

She liftes her arms above her head, crossing her wrists as if bound by an invisible chain.

$a[&#39;You are gorgeous,&#39;] you blurt out, before leaning in to bury your face in her breasts. You kiss them all over, gliding your hands up her perfect curves, her neck, shoulders, and arms, where you press her down as your kisses move from her breasts to her neck. you playfully lick and bite her ear, reveling in the pleasure of her soft skin.

When you finally lift your head up your eyes meet. $S[&#39;It&#39;s okay, sis. Follow your instincts.&#39;]

You swap your grip to hold her wrists with one hand and slide the other between her legs. You feel her welcoming warmth and her shivers of pleasure. Her pussy is growing metter with every caress of your fingers, and just like a sister echo, you can feel your own slit starting to drip down on her.

Do you think your mind can withstand such unearthly pleasures without devolving into madness?&#39;]

You remain quiet, shocked by the sudden change in her demeanor.

$S[&#39;Fine. Follow me and do **exactly** as I tell you.&#39;]

Sabrina takes a piece of chalk and gets on the floor, redrawing the pentagram and the runes around it. $S[&#39;It&#39;s important that the lines are intact when starting the ceremony,&#39;] she explains, going meticulously over every line and symbol. When she&#39;s satisfied with her work, she steps back and invites you to stand in the center. When you&#39;re there, she places metal cuffs on your wrists and ankles, chaining you to the pentagram.

$a[&#39;Uhm... is this really necessary...?&#39;]

$S[&#39;You&#39;re the one who wanted this, sis,&#39;] she replies with a flat tone. $S[&#39;Unless you&#39;ve changed your mind?&#39;]

The red glow around you continues to intensify. On the edges of the blinding red you can see black shadows begin to form, as if the void itself is starting to leek from beneath the floor.

Your vision shifts and a wave of neasuea hits you. The room is spinning around you. The darkness on the edges is rising higher and creeping towards the center, towards you. You feel every heartbeat in your chest. The hairs on your naked skin stand on edge as the black flames are closing in. 

You are naked. Defenceless. Vulnerable.

You take a deep breath and try to remain calm. $A[&#39;It&#39;s okay, Alex, you can totally do this...&#39;] You kneel in the center of the pentagram and wait for the invevitable.

The dark flams are closing in. Suddenly the darkness erupts, condensing into swirling black tentacles. They are all around you, your neasuea making them look like a swarm of black alge on some alien sea floor.

You feel the first slimy touch wrap around your leg and you shudder. A sense of impending doom washes over your mind, floosing all rational thought. $A[I have to get out, I have to get out, I have to get out...]

You spring to your feet, leaping out of the pentagram. For a brief moment the tentacles reach out to grab you, but then the spell fizzles and they disintegrate back into shadows. Slowly, the room returns to normal.

You take a deep breath and try to remain calm. $A[&#39;It&#39;s okay, Alex, you can totally do this...&#39;] You kneel in the center of the pentagram and wait for the invevitable.

The dark flams are closing in. Suddenly the darkness erupts, condensing into swirling black tentacles. They are all around you, your neasuea making them look like a swarm of black alge on some alien sea floor.

You feel the first slimy touch wrap around your leg. You shiver and close your eyes, trying to relax. To accept it. To enjoy it.

The tentacles touch your skin and begin to wrap around your limbs. They are cold and slimy, yet somehow making your skin burn, as if plunged into the flames of eternal lust and damnation.

They begin to spread your legs apart and you feel even more helpless, your crotch open and waiting for whatever unnatural pleasures they decide to inflict upon you. You take another deep breath. Your heart is racing. Cold sweat and hot shivers are running down your naked body. 

The tentacles stretch you in position and you brace yourself for what is to come. The tension is palpable, the air - dense. You feel all of your senses hightened in apprehensive anticipation. With a tinge of shame, you realize that your nipples are hard and erect, your pussy - hot and dripping.

You wait. Nothing is happening.

Your body is bound by the tentacles, but nothing seems to be happening. You slowly open your eyes, only to be greeted by a squirming black mass right in front of your face.

$a[&#39;Eeek!&#39;]

You recoil instinctively, twisting your neck back. In your current situation you can&#39;t move away very much, but you manage to gain a few precious inches.
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pentagram_trial_tentacles.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A massive tentacle has rizen right in front of you, its end dangling suspiciously close to your lips. 

The black fleshy mass looks even more repulsive than the rest of the tentacles. From up close you can see its muscles pulsating beneath the slimy skin, a row of irregular shaped suction cups lining the inner side of it. There are other, stranger things on it too, organic formations that you can&#39;t identify nor describe, with shapes that twitch ominously with every wriggle of the tentacle. A dark liquid is oozing out of its end and dripping down right on your naked breasts. 

The tentacle extends the tip forward, like an invitation.

Conflicting emotions wrestle within you. A part of you is utterly disgusted by the unearthly abomination, but another, deeper part is compelled by the proposition. The heat in your belly grows and you find yourself dancing on the edge between your human instincts and your supernatural lust.

Your lips hesitantly part and you hold your breath, transfixed on the horror wriggling infront of you.

The tentacle inches forward, the tip dancing just at the edge of your mouth. A drop of the black liquid drips down on your lower lip. It feels bitter and sweet and so wrong and so right. You can feel all of the tentacles holding your body firmly in place. Their gentle caresses have turned into an iron grip.

You wanted to go through with this, but now that you&#39;re in the midst of it, it&#39;s scary to think that there&#39;s no turning back. $A[I wonder what would the tentacles do if I refuse their invitation...] From somewhere far away, Sabrina&#39;s voice is saying something, but you can&#39;t quite make it out.

You give in wrap your lips around the offering, beginning to suck the black tentacle. Immediately the rest of the tendrils relax, loosening their hold on your limbs. Their touch becomes tender, almost caring. They slither between your thighs, teasing and promissing their unnatural debauchery. Your whole body sinks into their slimy embrace, shivering in pleasure and anticipation.

You feel a deep sense of relief, a deep part of your mind gives a small sigh of disappointment. $A[I wonder what would have happened to me if I hadn&#39;t accepted...] Images of a gruesome and ecstatic demise flash before your eyes. You feellike standing on the edge, just ready to jump...

You know what you have to do. It&#39;s so simple. And yet, almost impossible.

The pulsating black tentacle is just too repulsive. You try to force yourself to open your mouth and not think about it, but you just can&#39;t. The black mass has a putrid stench and is covered in unnatural shapes and bulges that look like living fungi covering a corpse.

Despite your best efforts, you twist your head to the side, feeling sick to your stomach.

$a[&#39;Get away from me!&#39;]

The tentacle makes a hissing sound, wiggling angrily towards your face.

$S[&#39;You should have taken the offer, sis,&#39;] comes a distant voice.

The rest of the black tentacles tighten their grip aggressively, trying to force you towards the oozing one. You fight back, resisting them as much as you can, but your chains are preventing you from leaving the pentagram. $A[Dammit, Sabrina...!]

You continue sycking on the hideous tentacle in a rhythmic trance, your lips moving back and forth around the uneven, wriggling texture. 

Drop after drop, the thick, black liquid oozes into your mouth and drips down your throat. It&#39;s sweet bitterness is unlike anything you&#39;ve ever tasted before. Strong and intoxicating, you feel as if it permeates your flesh, twisting and corrupting it in a subtle yet undeniable way.
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pentagram_trial_tentacles.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A sense of madness creeps upon you, but you have no choice but to embrace it. You no longer see the room around you, or hear Sabrina&#39;s voice. Darkness is creeping all around and now the darkness is making its way inside of you, drop by drop, sliding down your throat.

Your mind is spiraling. Something is comming. You know it in your bones. And you are ready for it. Your nipples stand shamefully erect, your holes gaping open. The tentacles are gently spreading your ass cheeks apart, but you know that it&#39;s for something else. Something that is yet to come.

The black tentacle in your mouth begins to tremble excitedly, then the drops abruptly stop. You can feel the tension building and you double your efforts, sucking the stem with a vigor and depravity that you didn&#39;t know you had.

Finally the tentacle erups, unloading a massive spurt of viscous liquid straight into your throat. You can sense something bubbling inside of it, something unnatural and *evil*. But it&#39;s too late to worry about that now.

You lose yourself in the moment completely, closing your eyes and giving in to pure touch, instinct and bliss. Something inside you is changing, and it feels so warm, so good, so *right*.

After a long while you find yourself in her embrace, her breath on your neck, her perfect breasts pressed against your own. The passion and lust is now replaed by a deep calm and a quiet joy. You feel a lot more in tune with your new body and the new sensations you feel.

$A[&#39;Please... someone... help...&#39;]
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/god_crying.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; &gt;
If there are any gods listening to your pleas, they do not reach out to help you. Luminescent tendrils hang over your head, dancing slowly in a mesmerizing way.

A presence washes over your mind and suddenly you gain an Understanding. You understand that you have failed. You were given the rarest opportunity to give yourself to something Greater and you tried to run away in fear.

Unfathomable $a[Shame] washes over you.

You now understand what you&#39;ve done and why you must accept this $a[Punishment].

Tears continue to roll down your face while your Undeserving holes are stuffed with the dark essence. Had you accepted it willingly, things would have been different. You know this for a fact, you understand it at the core of your mind.

Just as you understand why you must accepts the consequences of your failures.

Having gone beyond salvation, you allow your sentence to play out. Finally breaking out of your paralisis, your hips begin to push back against the unholy tube, a futile attempt to rince the guilt of your failure with the shame of your lust. 

Your body is burning.

Every spurt of darkness inside your womb swells your belly with more of the black corruption, disolving your sanity and unleashing the wickedness within you.

$a[&#39;Take me! I&#39;m ready!&#39;]

You begin to utter unthinkable things, professing how undeserving you are of the honor of being punished by the magnificent creature.

You feel it pump more and more of the Blackness within, and you open yourself willingly, weeping tears of shame and joy as you continue to grind against it, helping to punish yourself for your ungratefullness.

$a[&#39;Aaaah! Fill me!&#39;]

All of your senses are mixing together. The luminescent tendrils are dancing above your head and your ass is greedily grinding on the pulsating member. You feel a thousand bulges moving underneath the surface, twisting and turning and being pushed inside of you. Your mind is reaching the limits of sensation.

You scream.

Every fiber of your being is being defiled.

Every thought in your mind is being twisted.

Every vessel in your flesh is being corrupted.

You did this.

You deserve this.

You enjoy this.

This is your Punishment.

$S[&#39;Relax, sis, you&#39;re back now...&#39;]

You slowly open your eyes. You are back on the floor, in the dungeon. Sabrina is holding you gently. Your mind is hazy and you feel nauseous.

Memories rush to your head and you blush with embarrassment.

$a[&#39;What did I say....?&#39;]

$S[&#39;Don&#39;t worry about that,&#39;] she hushes you. $S[&#39;Are you alright?&#39;]

$a[&#39;I-I think so...&#39;]

You can barely remember what happened. Everything is just fading away second by second, like a distant dream. Was it even real?

You rub your eyes.

$S[&#39;Come on, up you go. Time to get you dressed&#39;]

You lift your ass higher and relax your opening, allowing your ass to stretch easily and accept the invader.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/god_ass.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; &gt;
The creature sinks in deep, defiling your mortal body with its grotesque member. You have become a willing offering to its desires.

As the creature begins to pump something inside of you, you wonder vaguely if this is some mighty old god that you have encountered, or just one among numerous others, attracted to your lust like some sort of abominable bee drawn to your nectar.

Your hole stretches further and something viscous splashes inside of you.

$a[&#39;Aaah...&#39;]

It feels strangely good, both terribly wrong and deeply intoxicating. You feel a sense of fullness and a perverse satisfaction of the act, of how helpless and utterly at the creature&#39;s mercy you are.

$a[&#39;Aaaaaahhh...&#39;]

Another spurt of viscous black corruption is injected inside of you, pushing the previous deeper into your gut. You can&#39;t see it but you *know* it, instinctively. You can feel the substance seeping into your flesh. You can smell the blackness of it. You cna hear it bubbling in your gut. You can taste its abominable smell.


$a[&#39;Aahh.... aaahh...&#39;]

Every new spurt makes you fuller and fuller. You feel the distorted member twitch in your ass, stretching it and sliding deeper and deeper inside of you. 

It is the most beautiful and exhilirating thing you have ever experienced.

For some reason, playing with fire seems so tempting. You begin to wiggle and struggle, managing to somehow shake the creature out of your ass.

$G[Insolent... mortal...]

You can feel the quiet anger in the mass above you.The legs grip you more firmly and push you back. A blade pushes under your chin and your head is forced up.
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/god_pussy.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The luminous tendrils are dancing right above you, captivating and viscious. You feel paralized, completely unable to move.

$A[I should have known...]

The twitching, fleshy tube prods again against your entrance, this time going for your pussy. You feel a sense of grim satisfaction that you managed to provoke the creature. But now you must brace for the inevitable. You feel the folds of your pussy opening up as the unspeakable angrily pushes inside of you.

You can&#39;t even move a muscle. As the tube continues to make its way deeper and deeper inside of you, you begin to realize the full extent of your helplessness. 

$A[Was this a mistake...?]

You begin to question your decision, but it&#39;s too late. A part of you is scared, but another is dripping with excitement. $A[You did this to yourself, Alex...]

You are all alone here, left at the mercy of whatever this thing is. You can feel it squirting something inside of you and to your great shame your pussy begins to twitch with pleasure, wrapping tightly around the unholy tube.
&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/god_pussy2.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Conflicting emotions begin to overwhelm you. Another spurt fills your body with a putrid discharge that feels like it&#39;s seeping into your very essence. 

Lust, hopelessness, euphoria and desperation wrestle your mind into a whirlwind of maddness. Tears begin to stream down your face while your lips open with moans outside of your control.

You gasp for air, kicking and fighting for your life. Just as you manage to take another breath, a second tentacle plunges to your crotch, this time aiming for your back entrance.

You feel your asshole being forced open and you squeal, temporarily faltering in your resistance. The big tentacle around your neck seizes the opportunity to pull you down again, strangling you while both of your holes are mercilessly pounded.

$a[&#39;Aaahh!!!&#39;]

$S[&#39;Just a few more moments, sis, hold on..!&#39;]

You can feel both invaders in your insides, rubbing against each other and multiplying the sensations. Even as you are fighting for your life, there is a perverse pleasure in it all and your juices flow down the slimy tendrils, ironically helping them to better slide in and out of your holes.

Just when your vision is almost gone and you feel the world fading away, you hear Sabrina shouting something and the tentacles retract, melting back into shadows.

You slowly open your eyes. Sabrina is holding you gently, looking concerned. You rub your neck.

Tears of joy start rolling down your cheeks as your ass is pumped over and over again with the black seed of the creature. You feel all reason abandon you and your mind descends into primal lust, spiraling into the carnal pits of unspeakable desires.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/tr/scenes/pentagram_god_end.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; &gt;
After an eternity, the creature is finally done with you. It lets go of your hips and detaches its member.

A black viscous stream begins to ooze out of you, dripping down your pussy and onto the ground.

$a[&#39;Nooo!&#39;]

A sense of loss hits you. Some of the beautiful creature&#39;s gifts are being wasted. You look longingly down at the black liquid underneath you. Your body convulses and a little more of it splashes out. 

Your tummy begins to hurt. The blackness is seeping into your flesh, burning you with pain and pleasure, while your body is fighting to get it out. You are torned between reason and insanity.

Ever so slowly, you let the black liquid ooze out of you. Your mind is still spinning in a hurricane of lust, but you have enough sanity left to know what is the right thing to do.

After everything is done, you collapse in the darkness, exhausted.

You cannot bear to lose the precious gift you have received. You clench your butt tightly and try to control the convulsions of your body, preventing any more of the thick liquid from coming out.

It is so painful.

Your body is fighting. It doesn&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing. Your mind is spinning. You can feel the corruption invading your flesh, sinking deeper and deeper in.

In a perverse folly, your pussy twitches with a masochistic glee, your juices spilling on the floor.

You laugh maniacally and you weep hysterically.

After a long while, it is done. Your convulsions stop, you no longer need to keep it in. all of the black corruption has been absorbed within you.
